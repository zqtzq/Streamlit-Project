The tower crane was lifting a bundle of scaffolding\nmaterial when the jib1 failed. This resulted in the load and the hook block of the tower crane plummeting\ndown to the ground. The accident killed one worker and injured another.\n2 MOM introduced the concept of a Learning Report in 2019 under section 27A of the Workplace\nSafety and Health Act, as a way for industry to be informed about hazards they are not aware of, as soon as\npossible after an accident, without having to wait for the conclusion of criminal proceeding. The sole\nobjective of the Learning Report is to educate industry to prevent the recurrence of workplace incidents,\nwhere the WSH risks are not well understood, could be present in other companies, and have the potential\nfor serious harm.\n3 In consultation with industry stakeholders, MOM has published a Learning Report on the above\naccident to alert the industry on the relevant learning points. It was found that the crane\u2019s Erection Ropes2\nare at risk of becoming entangled with the fixed structure of the crane during lifting operations. The\nentanglement can prevent the jib from being lowered properly.\n4 MOM recommends that Erection Ropes should be removed or disconnected and stowed securely on\nLuffing Jib Tower Cranes after the jib installation. This is to eliminate any risk of accidental entanglement of\nthe Erection Ropes with any fixed structure of the cranes. If the removal or disconnection of the Erection\nRopes is not practicable or it introduces additional risks, a review is required to identify any potential\nentanglement points and mitigate the risks of accidental entanglement of the Erection Ropes at these points.\nSupport brackets to contain and guide the Erection Ropes in position should also be adequately designed to\nprevent unintended slippage during the repeated raising and lowering of the jib.\n1 The jib of a tower crane is the elevated structural member beneath which suspended loads may be moved vertically or horizontally, either by slewing\nthe machine or derricking the jib of the tower crane;\n2 Erection Ropes are typically used to hold and balance the jib in position for the crane erectors to secure the jib onto the tower crane main structure\nduring the tower crane installation, maintenance and dismantling operation.\nMinistry of Manpower Occupational Safety and Health Division\nMOM Services Centre, 1500 Bendemeer Road, Singapore 339946 Web www.mom.gov.sg Contact us www.mom.gov.sg/contact Tel 65 6438 5122 Page 1 of 2\nCircular: Recommendation from Learning Report for Fatal Accident Involving Failure of Tower Crane\n5 While investigations are still ongoing, we urge the industry to consider the learning points, and take\ngreater ownership in adopting safe practices in the installation, dismantling, maintenance, and safe operation\nof tower cranes. Owners of Luffing Jib Tower Cranes are required to take the necessary steps to comply with\nthe above recommendation immediately. MOM will conduct inspections of Luffing Jib Tower Cranes over the\nnext few weeks to check that the risks of entanglement of Erection Ropes has been mitigated.\n6 The full Learning Report is attached in this circular.

About the Incident\n1.1 On 4 November 2019, the jib of a Luffing Jib Tower Crane failed during a lifting\noperation at a construction worksite along Tan Tock Seng Link, near central Singapore.\nThe occupier of the worksite was Kajima Overseas Asia (Singapore) Pte Ltd.\n1.2 On the said morning, the Luffing Jib Tower Crane (\u201cthe TC\u201d) was lifting a bundle of\nscaffolding material when the jib of the TC suddenly buckled. This resulted in the load\nand the hook block of the TC plummeting down to the ground. The accident resulted\nin one fatality and an injury to another worker. A photograph of the TC post-accident,\nwith its deformed jib, is shown in Figure 1 & Figure 2.\nFigure 1 \u2013 General view of the TC after the accident\n1\nLearning Report involving Failure of Luffing Jib Tower Crane at\nKajima Overseas Asia (Singapore) Pte Ltd\u2019s Worksite Located at Tan Tock Seng Link\nNovember 2020\nFigure 2 - Side view of the TC after the accident\n2. Luffing Jib Tower Cranes\n2.1 Operating Principle\n2.1.1 Luffing Jib Tower Cranes are a type of tower crane that vary their working radius by\nraising or lowering their jib through a luffing jib system. The upper portion of a Luffing\nJib Tower Crane is shown in Figure 3.\n2\nLearning Report involving Failure of Luffing Jib Tower Crane at\nKajima Overseas Asia (Singapore) Pte Ltd\u2019s Worksite Located at Tan Tock Seng Link\nNovember 2020\nLuffing System\nTo luffing\nwinch\nJib\nA-frame\nHead\nErection\nRope\nHook Block\nCounter\nweights\nJib\nBumper\nOperator\nCabin\nLuffing\nWinch\n(hidden)\nFigure 3 - Upper Portion of the TC\n2.2 Installation of a Luffing Jib Tower Crane and Erection Ropes\n2.2.1 Luffing Jib Tower Cranes are installed on-site. The installation process begins with the\ncasting of a strong concrete foundation for the tower crane to be sited on. This is\nfollowed by the installation and assembly of the various components, including the\nmast sections, slew ring, operator cabin, counter-jib, counter-weights, A-frame and jib\nsections.\nErection Ropes\n2.2.2 During the jib installation process, Erection Ropes are typically used to hold and\nbalance the jib in position for the crane erectors to install and secure the jib onto the\nA-frame head (please see Figure 4 and Figure 5).\n3\nLearning Report involving Failure of Luffing Jib Tower Crane at\nKajima Overseas Asia (Singapore) Pte Ltd\u2019s Worksite Located at Tan Tock Seng Link\nNovember 2020\nErection Ropes holding the jib\n3\u2070 to 15\u2070\nFigure 4 - Function of Erection Ropes of a Luffing Jib Tower Crane\nErection Ropes\nFigure 5 - Erection Ropes of luffing jib when the jib is lowered\n2.2.3 Erection Ropes usually come in a pair, with one end of each rope secured to the A-\nframe head and the other end secured to one of the jib sections (please see Figure 4).\nErection Ropes can come in a single length or as an assembly comprising of shorter\nlengths of ropes. The length of the jib determines the length of the Erection Ropes\nused and the location on the jib they are secured to. This ensures that the Erection\nRopes used are of optimal length (not excessively long or short). The specific length\nand position of installation of the Erection Ropes are prescribed in the tower crane\nmanual.\n2.2.4 After the luffing system of the jib has been installed, the Erection Ropes play no further\nrole in the function and operation of the tower crane.\n4\nLearning Report involving Failure of Luffing Jib Tower Crane at\nKajima Overseas Asia (Singapore) Pte Ltd\u2019s Worksite Located at Tan Tock Seng Link\nNovember 2020\nManagement of Erection Ropes\n2.2.5 Some tower crane manufacturers recommend for the Erection Ropes to be removed\nafter the jib installation. In such cases, the Erection Ropes are required to be\nreinstalled back onto the cranes before any jib maintenance or dismantling of the\ncranes can occur.\n2.2.6 However, there are other tower crane manufacturers who allow for the Erection\nRopes to be left on the tower cranes after the jib installation (as in the case for this\nTC). This eases subsequent jib maintenance and dismantling of the cranes, as the\nErection Ropes need not be reinstalled back onto the cranes. Some manufacturers\nalso recommend leaving the Erection Ropes on the tower cranes to support the jib in\nthe event of troubleshooting or repair of a defective jib mechanism. Leaving the\nErection Ropes on the tower cranes also eliminate working at height risks during its\nre-installation.\n2.2.7 For Erection Ropes that are left on the tower cranes after the jib installation, the\namount of slack in the Erection Ropes will vary during operation - they will have more\nslack when the jib is raised and less slack when the jib is lowered. As such, support\nbrackets are often provided on the tower crane to contain and guide the Erection\nRopes into its proper resting position and prevent excessive dangling of the Erection\nRopes when the jib is raised (please see Figure 6).\nSupport\nbracket on\nJib Bumper\nSupport\nbracket on\nJib Section\nFigure 6 - Erection Ropes rest in the support bracket when the jib is raised\n5\nLearning Report involving Failure of Luffing Jib Tower Crane at\nKajima Overseas Asia (Singapore) Pte Ltd\u2019s Worksite Located at Tan Tock Seng Link\nNovember 2020\n3. Findings from Accident Investigation\n3.1 Sequence of Events\n3.1.1 The sequence of events that led to the accident was:\na) The TC was operated to lift a load at the time of the accident.\nb) The TC\u2019s jib was raised to reach the load which was positioned near to the TC\u2019s mast.\nDuring the process, the Erection Ropes slackened and the right Erection Rope likely\nslipped out of its support bracket instead of resting within it, as shown in Figure 7.\nc) After the load was picked up, the TC\u2019s jib was lowered to reach the intended unloading\nposition. During the process, as the Erection Ropes straightened, the right Erection\nRope became entangled with the outer pivot joint on the right side of the A-frame,\n(please see Figure 8).\nd) The entanglement of the right Erection Rope caused a mechanical restriction to the\nluffing function of the jib of the TC i.e. the jib was prevented from being lowered\nfurther.\ne) The attempt to continue luffing down the TC\u2019s jib resulted in the luffing winch\ncontinuing to unspool and thereby releasing the luffing wire rope from the drum. As\nthe luffing wire rope became slackened, the entangled right Erection Rope began to\ntake on the weight of the jib and the suspended load. Under continual stress, the right\nErection Rope eventually failed at the entanglement point, and the jib jerked\ndownwards in free-fall.\nf) As the jib was held back by the luffing wire rope, it buckled at jib section #3 as it fell.\nThe buckling of the jib occurred after the jib started to fall and was not the cause of\nthe accident.\ng) Consequently, the hook block and load also plummeted down to the ground, hitting\nthe deceased and another worker who were working in the vicinity.\nh) The TC was not overloaded at the time of the accident.\ni) The full sequence of events is illustrated in Figure 9.\n6\nLearning Report involving Failure of Luffing Jib Tower Crane at\nKajima Overseas Asia (Singapore) Pte Ltd\u2019s Worksite Located at Tan Tock Seng Link\nNovember 2020\nErection Rope rested\nwithin the support\nbracket at jib bumper\nand dangled in front of\npivot joint\nSupport Support\nbracket bracket\nPivot Joint\nErection Rope slipped\nout of support bracket at\njib bumper and dangled\nbelow pivot joint\nFigure 7 - Schematic views of Erection Rope in and out of the support bracket\nEntangled\nNormal Erection Erection Rope\nRope\nEntanglement\npoint\nFigure 8 - Schematic views of the TC showing conditions with normal and entangled Erection Rope\n7\nLearning Report involving Failure of Luffing Jib Tower Crane at\nKajima Overseas Asia (Singapore) Pte Ltd\u2019s Worksite Located at Tan Tock Seng Link\nNovember 2020\nSlackened\nluffing rope\nEntanglement\npoint\nThe entanglement of the right\nErection Rope restricted the jib from\nbeing luffed down.

This was deliberate so\nthat the Erection Ropes could move freely as it slackened or tightened depending on\nwhether the jib was raised or lowered. The support brackets were not meant to be\nload bearing.\n3.2.2 When the Erection Ropes were not positioned within the support brackets, they would\ndangle below the A-frame (please see Figure 7), resulting in the possibility of them\nbeing entangled with other parts of the crane. As the jib was subsequently lowered,\nany entanglement would cause mechanical restriction to the luffing of the jib of the\ntower crane and could impact the operation of the crane.\nEntanglement Risks\n3.2.3 There was a groove/gap at the connection between the main and supporting frame of\nthe A-frame at the pivot joint (please see Figure 10). The size of the gap was about the\nsize of the diameter of the Erection Rope. This created an entanglement risk when the\nErection Rope glided past the pivot joint while the jib was being lowered.\nFigure 10 - Close-up view of the right pivot joint of the A-frame\n9\nLearning Report involving Failure of Luffing Jib Tower Crane at\nKajima Overseas Asia (Singapore) Pte Ltd\u2019s Worksite Located at Tan Tock Seng Link\nNovember 2020\n4. Learning Points\nMOM has checked with industry stakeholders and could not find any similar incident of tower\ncrane failure involving Erection Ropes globally. Hence, it is critical to establish the learning\npoints from the incident to prevent recurrence.\nBased on the findings gathered from this incident, two learning points were derived.\n4.1 Eliminate Risk of Entanglement between Erection Ropes and other Structures\n4.1.1 Whenever the jib is being raised or lowered, the Erection Ropes will progressively shift\nfrom a more slackened to a less slackened configuration, and the lengths of the\nErection Ropes will glide past fixed structures of the upper body of the tower crane.\nWhile some manufacturers recommend that it is acceptable for the Erection Ropes to\nbe left on the tower cranes during the operation phase, MOM has consulted industry\nstakeholders and recommend that, notwithstanding manufacturers\u2019\nrecommendation, Erection Ropes should be removed or disconnected and stowed\nsecurely on the crane after the jib installation. This is to eliminate any risk of\naccidental entanglement of the Erection Ropes with any fixed structure of the tower\ncrane as the Erection Ropes will not be in tension even when the jib is being lowered.\n4.1.2 If the removal or disconnection of the Erection Ropes is not practicable or it introduces\nadditional risks, crane manufacturers and suppliers will need to review and identify\nany potential entanglement points and mitigate the risks of accidental entanglement\nof the Erection Ropes at these points. For the TC involved in the accident, this could\nbe done by way of reviewing the design of the pivot joint to eliminate the presence of\nthe groove/gap or installing a purpose-built protective guard to cover the\nentanglement points, to reduce the risk of entanglement.\n4.2 Ensure Erection Ropes return to their Resting Position\n4.2.1 Erection Ropes are secured at their ends. Hence, their lengths are free to progressively\nslacken to correspond to the movement (raising or lowering) of the jib. For cases\nwhere the Erection Ropes are not removed or disconnected, any support brackets to\ncontain and guide the Erection Ropes in position, should be adequately designed to\nprevent unintended slippage during the repeated raising and lowering of the jib. To\nensure that the Erection Ropes will return to their resting position within the support\nbrackets, regular testing (without load) by repeated raising and lowering of the jib\nshould be carried out to check if there is any unintended or excessive slippage of the\nErection Ropes.\n10\nLearning Report involving Failure of Luffing Jib Tower Crane at\nKajima Overseas Asia (Singapore) Pte Ltd\u2019s Worksite Located at Tan Tock Seng Link\nNovember 2020\n5. Relevant Industry Practices\nIn addition to the learning points discussed in Section 4, the following practices should also\nbe adopted for the use of Luffing Jib Tower Cranes:\n5.1 Conduct Regular Examination and Inspection of Tower Cranes\n5.1.1 To ensure the safe operation of tower cranes, it is imperative to conduct regular\nexamination, inspection and testing to detect any deviations from safe operating\nconditions. This will ensure that defects or anomalies are rectified promptly, and that\nthe tower cranes are in good working condition and safe for its intended use.\n5.1.2 Inspections should include checks on Erection Ropes and support brackets to ensure\nthat they are in good working condition. Although the Erection Ropes are not required\nfor the function and operation of the Luffing Jib Tower Crane, any anomaly found on\nthe Erection Ropes, such as wear features and abrasion marks, could suggest\nlikelihood of unidentified hazards, such as possible entanglement or abrasion of\nErection Ropes.\n5.2 Ensure Installation, Dismantling and Repair of Tower Cranes are done in accordance\nto Manufacturer\u2019s Recommendations\n5.2.1 Installation, dismantling and repair of tower cranes shall only be conducted by\nApproved Crane Contractors1 (ACC) with the relevant scope. The ACC shall plan the\ninstallation thoroughly to ensure that the operation is proceeded safely, efficiently\nand without incident.\n5.2.2 The ACC shall ensure that the installation of the tower cranes is done in accordance to\nthe crane manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Any deviation from the specified procedure\nshould be approved by the crane manufacturers to ensure that the safe operation of\nthe tower cranes will not be compromised after the installation. The ACC should also\nensure that all the crane components are inspected prior to installation to ensure they\nare of good construction, sound material, adequate strength and free from patent\ndefects.\n5.2.3 The length and position of the Erection Ropes installed on the jib sections must\nconform to the crane manufacturers\u2019 recommendation. While having Erection Ropes\nof an excessive length may increase the stresses on the crane during installation of the\nluffing system, a shorter length may restrict the reach of the jib and cause undue loads\non the Erection Ropes. Hence, Erection Ropes of an optimal length shall be used in\n1 Approved Crane Contractor is any firm or company which is the holder of a valid certificate of approval issued by the Commissioner under\nthe Workplace Safety and Health Act to conduct installation, repair, alteration or dismantling of mobile or tower crane.\n11\nLearning Report involving Failure of Luffing Jib Tower Crane at\nKajima Overseas Asia (Singapore) Pte Ltd\u2019s Worksite Located at Tan Tock Seng Link\nNovember 2020\naccordance to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations, specific to the length of the luffing\njib of the tower crane.\n5.2.4 It is also critical to ensure that the pair of Erection Ropes installed on the tower crane\nare of the same length to prevent imbalanced loadings on the ropes.\n5.3 Implement proper Lifting Plans to ensure Safe Lifting Operations\n5.3.1 All lifting operations shall be accompanied by a Lifting Plan and supported by a risk\nassessment, permit-to-work system, safe work procedures and method statements.\nThe Lifting Plan shall be developed in accordance to generally accepted principles of\nsafe and sound practice and shall include critical information that must be considered\nin a lifting operation such as safe working load of tower crane, rigging details,\ncommunication of lifting crew and demarcation of lifting and exclusion zones.\n6. Conclusion\nWorkplaces utilising the use of Luffing Jib Tower Cranes are reminded to take heed of the\nlearning points and implement effective risk control measures to prevent any similar\nrecurrences. In summary, the two key learning points from this incident are:\n1) Eliminate Risk of Entanglement between Erection Ropes and other Structures; and\n2) Ensure Erection Ropes return to their Resting Position.\n12",

        "content": "1 June 2016\nCIRCULAR ON SAFE STORAGE OF COMBUSTIBLE MATERIALS IN CONSTRUCTION\nOn 3 Mar 2016, a fire broke out at a construction worksite after sparks from hot\nworks carried out at an elevated structure ignited polyfoam boards placed at the ground level.\nOn 27 Nov 2015, polystyrene boards that were used to fill up the void under a concrete slab\nat the ground caught fire when sparks from welding works at a higher storey dropped onto\nthe boards. A year before, on 3 Mar 2015, reinforcement bars were being removed from a\nparapet wall using a cutting torch when sparks landed on the planter box fitted with polyfoam\nwhich subsequently caused a fire.\n2. We have seen an increasing trend in fire accidents at construction worksites\ninvolving combustible materials. It is not uncommon for such materials to be used as in-fill\nmaterials or building materials in construction. From recent observations where such\naccidents have occurred, hot works were seen to be carried out above or near the areas\nwhere combustible materials were stored or placed. Such materials were also not covered or\nplaced away from sources of fire.\n3. Due to the combustible nature of the materials and the possibility of resulting\nemission of large quantities of smoke and/or toxic fumes which poses a health hazard\nto persons in the vicinity, contractors are to take greater care to ensure that fire\npreventive measures are in place.\nRequirements under WSH Act\n4. Under Regulation 37(1) of the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) (General\nProvisions) Regulations, Occupiers are required to take all reasonable practicable steps to\nkeep sources of heat or ignition separate from: a) flammable materials in the workplace or b)\nprocesses that may give rise to flammable gas or vapour. Section 11 of the Workplace\nSafety and Health Act also requires that measures are taken to ensure that articles or\nsubstances kept on the worksite are safe and without risks to health to every person\nwithin those premises.\nPage 1 of 2\nSafe practices for storage of combustible materials in construction\n5. Improper use and storage of combustible materials without the necessary fire\nprevention measures may result in fire. This would then lead to injuries, property damage or\neven loss of lives. Some prevention measures can include, but are not limited to:\ni) Controlling and minimising the amount of combustible materials delivered and\nstored in the workplace until it is needed for the work processes;\nii) When necessary, store combustible materials in an open area outside the\nbuilding under construction with proper fire-retardant protective sheets or covers\nover the combustible materials and away from possible ignition sources, if any.\nFire-retardant protective sheets or covers shall be properly secured at all times to\nensure that combustible materials are not exposed; and\niii) Implement safe work procedures to ensure that hot works are not carried out in\nproximity to combustible materials.\n6. We wish to remind all Occupiers to ensure their due diligence on the above and that\nlegal action will be taken against any Occupier who fails to perform his/her duties under the\nAct.\n7.

We would like to draw your attention to the following\ninformation with respect to QOC and pressure test.\nDesign Requirements for QOC\n2. A QOC is a cover that can be opened or closed more quickly than a standard bolted flange\nconnection to access to the contents space of a pressure vessel/equipment. A QOC is required to\nbe designed to an appropriate design code, for example, the American Society of Mechanical\nEngineers Boilers and Pressure Vessels Code (ASME Code).\n3 In accordance with Section VIII Division 1 of the ASME Code, QOC shall be designed such\nthat the locking elements will not disengage until the pressure in the vessel is released. The QOC\nmust also be designed such that the failure of a single locking component while the vessel is\npressurised will not:\na) cause or allow the closure to be opened or to leak; or\nb) result in the failure of any other locking component or holding element\n4 QOC shall also be designed so that all locking components can be verified to be fully engaged\nby visual observation or other means prior to the application of pressure to the vessel.\n5 Manually operated QOC must be equipped with an audible or visible warning device that will\nwarn the operator if pressure is applied to the vessel before the holding elements and locking\ncomponents are fully engaged or if an attempt is made to disengage the locking mechanism before\nthe pressure within the vessel is released. Additional recommendations in the areas of design,\ninstallation, maintenance, inspection as stipulated in the code should be adhered to where\npracticable.\nPneumatic Test\n6. Due to the large amount of energy stored in compressed air and the potential hazard of a\nsudden release of this energy, pneumatic test should be avoided whenever possible. A pneumatic\ntest should only be considered if a hydrostatic test has been carefully reviewed and determined not\nto be feasible. When pneumatic test is necessary, there are many critical safety precautions that\nmust be considered, for example, code of construction requirements for pneumatic test (e.g., UW-50\nfor ASME Section VIII Div. 1). Risk assessment must be conducted and effective control measures\nmust be put in place to mitigate the identified hazards. These could include barricading the affected\narea and having proper procedures for raising and holding pressures for the test.\n7.

        "content": "Circular: Safety Requirements for Installation of Photovoltaic (PV) System\nMOM/OSHD/2023-06\nDate: 8 September 2023\nTo: All Photovoltaic (PV) System Contractors, Installers and Other Interested Persons\nCircular on Safe Installation of Photovoltaic (PV) System\nOn 12 June 2023, a worker was electrocuted after coming into contact with the\nexposed cable of photovoltaic panel (PV) (refer to Annex A). He was subsequently conveyed\nto the hospital where he passed away on the same day.\n2. As the installation of PV panels (or commonly known as solar panels) gains\nacceptance and wide adoption by building owners, it is crucial that industry stakeholders\ninvolved in installation of PV panels carry it out safely. In particular, MOM would like to highlight\nthe following key risks and control measures for industry\u2019s compliance.\nWorking at Height\n3. As most PV panels are installed on the roof of the building, workers are exposed to the\nrisks of falling from heights. The risks extend to workers undertaking preparatory work such\nas cleaning and waterproofing prior to the installation of the PV panels. Thus safe work-at-\nheight measures must include, but not limited to, the following:\ni) Establish and implement a Fall Prevention Plan (FPP) and a permit-to-work\nsystem before commencing any installation of PV system on the roof;\nii) Ensure that the risk control measures as stated in the FPP and permit-to-work\n(e.g., the use of travel restraint or fall arrest systems) have been communicated\nto the workers involved and implemented onsite;\niii) Ensure that the workers involved are adequately trained to be familiarised with\nthe hazards associated with working at height, and that they adhere to the risk\ncontrol measures as implemented (e.g., wearing of body harness, secured to\nproper anchorage at all times, etc) when working on the roof.\nInstallation of PV system\n4. The PV panels installed in open spaces such as rooftops, generate electricity when\nexposed to sunlight, even before the connection of the PV modules is completed or\ncommissioned. Workers involved in PV panel installations must be briefed on electrical safety\nrequirements, which shall include but not limiting to the requirements stipulated within the\nElectricity Act, the Electricity (Electrical Installations) Regulations and the Singapore Standard\n638 - Code of Practice for Electrical Installations. The installation of the PV system shall be\nundertaken, carried out and/or supervised by a Licensed Electrical Worker (LEW) of the\nappropriate class.\nCircular: Safety Requirements for Installation of Photovoltaic (PV) System\n5. Safety measures for the installation of PV modules shall include, but not limited to, the\nfollowing:\ni) Ensure that the installation of PV module is in accordance to the PV single line\ndiagram that has been approved and endorsed by a LEW of the appropriate\nclass and to conduct open circuit voltage (V oc) measurement immediately on\nnewly installed PV arrays to ensure that the total voltage does not exceed 1000\nV DC;\nii) Ensure that no live parts or conductors are exposed. Any breakdown or\ndamage to the insulation of the cables and connectors shall be reported to the\nLEW immediately.\niii) Treat all conductors as live, unless advised by the LEW otherwise; and\niv) All persons carrying out the installation must be equipped with appropriate\npersonal protective equipment (PPE), such as safety shoes, insulative rubber\ngloves (OSHA rating: at least class 0), etc.\nRisk Management\n6. In addition to the above risks, before commencing any work, a risk assessment (RA)\nmust be conducted to evaluate the safety and health risks posed to any person who may be\naffected by the installation of the PV system. The RA must include, but not limited to, the\nfollowing work activities and factors:\ni) Safe access to and egress from the work area and working at height;\nii) Assessment of the roof\u2019s structural integrity;\niii) Installation of PV system;\niv) Assessment of weather conditions;\nv) Emergency responses, etc.\n7. All reasonably practicable steps must be taken to ensure that the necessary risk control\nmeasures and safe work procedures are implemented to minimise and control the risks arising\nfrom the installation of PV system and working at height, among other considerations.\n8.

The following should be considered\nin the design of storage racks:\na) Storage racks must be structurally stable and designed with the intended use in mind (e.g. weight,\nvolume, shape, dimensions, environment to be used in etc.).\nb) The safe working load of the storage racks should be prominently displayed. In particular, if the storage\nracks are stacked, the lower racks must be designed to take into account of the weight of the upper\nracks and their corresponding goods.\nc) There should be safe means of access to the goods being stored, including proper work-at-heights\nmeasures.\nd) The physical environment where the storage racks are to be used should be considered. For example,\nracks that are placed in areas where there is vehicular moment (e.g. forklifts, reach trucks etc) should\nbe designed to withstand impact from possible collisions. In a cold room environment, temperature\nswings may require special considerations for corrosion protection due to moisture and other effects\non the structural integrity of storage racks.\ne) A re-assessment of the storage rack\u2019s design should be carried before any change of use, including a\nchange in the nature of goods to be stored.\n2) Use of Storage Racks\nThe following measures are to be taken when using storage racks:\na) Use of storage racks should be carried out in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nb) Conduct a risk assessment for the use of the storage racks.\nc) Establish safe work procedures for work activities involving storage racks. The procedures should\ninclude confirming that the combined weight of the intended goods to be stored does not exceed the\nsafe working load of the racks. In particular, if the racks are stacked, the bottom racks must have\nsufficient loading capacity to hold the racks and goods stored above.\nd) Ensure that warehouse personnel made aware of the safe working loads and are trained on the safe\nwork procedures for stacking and/or storage of goods.\n3) Maintenance of Storage Racks\nThe following measures are to be taken when maintaining storage racks:\na) Maintenance of the storage racks should be carried out in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s\ninstruction.\nb) Storage racks and accompanying accessories (including pallets) should be regularly inspected to ensure\ntheir structural integrity (for example, no signs of damage or corrosion). Any defective part must be\nrepaired or replaced before use.\nMinistry of Manpower Services Centre\n1500 Bendemeer Road Singapore 339946 Web http://www.mom.gov.sg Email mom_oshd@mom.gov.sg Page 2 of 2",

The person using the lift was not aware\nthat a worker was on top of the lift car. The worker was conveyed to hospital where he succumbed\nto his injuries and passed away the following day.\n2 Lift Contractors and owners, are advised to ensure that their lifts, when installed, comply with\nthe prevailing code of practice (SS 550:2009 \u2013 Code of Practice for Installation, Operation and\nMaintenance of Electric Passenger and Goods Lifts), especially those requirements related to the\ncar top clearance.\n3 In addition, occupiers and employers, and other persons in control of similar workplaces and\nwork activities, are advised to consider the following risk control measures to prevent such accidents\nfrom recurring:\nRisk Assessment\n4 Occupiers and employers shall conduct a thorough Risk Assessment (RA) for all work activities\nto manage any foreseeable risk that may arise while carrying out lift maintenance. The RA shall\ninclude, but not be limited to, the following areas:\n\uf0b7 Entrapment on lift car top\n\uf0b7 Hit by stationery parts in lift hoist way\n\uf0b7 Contact with electrical terminations\n\uf0b7 Fall through gap between lift and hoist way; and\n\uf0b7 Exposure to asbestos brake lining\nEnergy Isolation\n5 It is critical to ensure that hazardous energy sources are properly de-energised and isolated\nbefore commencing lift maintenance work. This is to prevent the lift from being accidentally\nenergised prior to the completion of maintenance work. A Lockout and Tagout (LOTO) procedure\nshall also be implemented.\n6 When removing a lift from service, ensure that the lift car is empty and appropriate hazard\nsigns and/or entry barriers are in place. These are important hazard communication tools.\nPre-Maintenance Check\n7 Before working on top of a lift car, maintenance personnel shall observe the following:\n\uf0b7 Place the lift in maintenance or inspection mode\n\uf0b7 Check for proper operation of the lift car top controls\n\uf0b7 Ensure there are means to interrupt the control circuit for preventing undue or\nunintended car movement during maintenance\n\uf0b7 Verify that necessary control measures have been implemented for all foreseeable\nrisks\n\uf0b7 Familiarise with the procedures for safe re-activation of lift car movement\n\uf0b7 Check with the manufacturer or supplier on whether existing brake linings in the lift\nmotor to be serviced contain asbestos. Documentary proof can be provided or in lieu\nof that, an asbestos survey can be conducted to ascertain the presence of asbestos in\nthe brake linings.\nMaintenance Requirements\n8 Lift service contractors should also be familiar with the maintenance outcome requirements\ndetailed under the Building Maintenance and Strata Management (Lift, Escalator and Building\nMaintenance) Regulations 2016 (the \u201cRegulations\u201d). The Regulations prescribes a set of 20\nmaintenance outcomes (see Annex A) that must be achieved by the lift service contractor during\nthe monthly maintenance.\nEmergency Procedure\n9 Maintenance personnel shall be familiar with the emergency response procedures in order to\ndeal with emergencies promptly and safely.\n10 Depending on the emergency situation, appropriate responses shall be developed prior to\nwork commencement. Emergency stop devices shall be readily accessible by the maintenance\npersonnel to allow all sources of energy to be immediately and safely disconnected in response to\nan incident or hazardous situation. Self-rescue may be carried out only when the hazards are known\nand the worker can initiate the self-rescue in a safe manner. If self-rescue is not possible, support\nfrom trained emergency response personnel (e.g. SCDF or a co-worker) may be required.\n11 It is important to provide effective means of communication between maintenance personnel\nwithin and outside the lift hoist way (e.g. through use of radio communication devices) during\nmaintenance work and with rescue personnel during emergencies.\nAsbestos Hazard during Lift Maintenance Work\n12 Brake linings containing asbestos may be found in lift motors, especially so in older lifts. There\nis a possibility that asbestos fibres may be released due to wear and tear of the linings over a period\nof time. Hence, it is important to check for asbestos hazard before commencing lift maintenance\nwork.\n13 If it is ascertained that the lift brake lining contains asbestos (through documentary proof or\nasbestos survey), safe work procedures for work involving asbestos shall be established and the\nwork carried out shall comply with the WSH (Asbestos) Regulations Part III \u2013 General Provisions for\nwork involving asbestos. Maintenance personnel shall be equipped with suitable respiratory\nprotection and be trained in asbestos hazard. Maintenance work involving replacement of asbestos\nbrake lining shall only be carried out by an Approved Asbestos-Removal Contractor and an asbestos\nwork notification is required to be submitted to MOM prior to the commencement of work.\nShould you need further information, you can refer to the following resources:\n\uf0b7 MOM website on workplace safety and health\nhttps://www.mom.gov.sg/workplace-safety-and-health\n\uf0b7 BCA Lift Safety website\nhttps://www.bca.gov.sg/LiftSafety/lift_industry.html\nEr.

Investigations revealed that\nthe landing gate could be opened from inside the building when the lift was not at the\nlanding. This is contrary to the requirement that such gate is to be fitted with efficient\ninterlocking or other devices such that the gate cannot be opened except when the\nlift is at the landing and that it cannot be moved away from the landing until the gate\nis closed.\n2 Another fatal accident occurred recently at a building construction worksite\nwhen a lift plunged 7 floors to the ground. This resulted in the death of a worker who\nwas in the lift. Preliminary investigations revealed that the original motors,\ngearboxes and safety device had been replaced with a different brand of similar\ncomponents.\n3 Approved Persons are reminded to exercise due diligence in their inspections\nof lifts and hoists and ensure that the statutory requirements stipulated under Section\n29 of the Factories Act are complied with. They are also to verify that if there is any\nreplacement of the motors, gearboxes, safety devices and other components of the\nlift / hoist, it must be of the type approved by the manufacturer.\nYours faithfully,\nTAN GEOK LENG\nfor CHIEF INSPECTOR OF FACTORIES\nDate of Issue Classification: Circular No: CIF A32.4.1\n15 Oct 2004 Lifts & Hoists OSD/ ENG CIR / LE 2/04 Page 1 of 1",

When the temperature is increased to 160-\n170\u00baC and above, it will spontaneously ignite without an external spark or flame.\n\u2022 Organic solvents commonly used to damp nitrocellulose are also highly flammable.\nThe organic solvent used also plays a part in determining when nitrocellulose will\nburn, whether on its own or with a heat source supplied.\nStability & Reactivity\n\u2022 Nitrocellulose is stable under normal temperature and pressure. However, it is shock-sensitive and will break\ndown upon heating to produce toxic gases such as oxides of nitrogen and carbon monoxide.\n\u2022 Both dry and damped nitrocellulose react easily with strong oxidising agents, including strong acids and bases,\nto produce oxides of nitrogen.\nHealth Hazards\n\u2022 Inhaling nitrocellulose can irritate your nose and throat.\n\u2022 Contact with nitrocellulose can irritate your skin and eyes. It can also cause dryness of skin and dermatitis.\n\u2022 The common damping agent isopropyl alcohol can irritate the eyes and skin. Due to its higher vapour pressure,\nisopropyl alcohol is more volatile than nitrocellulose and thus its vapours are easily inhaled.\n\u2022 Exposure to high concentrations of the solvents used as damping agents can cause dizziness, difficulties in\nbreathing, and even result in unconsciousness.\n\u2022 Long-term exposure to damped nitrocellulose can lead to chronic health effects such as kidney and liver\ndamage, depression of the central nervous system and permanent eye damage.\n\u2022 Toxic gases, such as oxides of nitrogen, hydrogen cyanide and carbon monoxide, which may be produced\nduring decomposition or combustion of nitrocellulose also pose health hazards.\nRef: 2000-07\nSafety Measures to Observe \u2022 When handling drums containing nitrocellulose,\ndo not allow them to fall or bump into each other.\nTake all necessary precautionary measures when If possible, use a fork-lift for loading or unloading\nhandling nitrocellulose.

The in the worksite.\nSOA can be a metal or plastic cabinet\nor a portable box in which the various\nelectrical protective devices are\nhoused. It is typically equipped with up\nto 9 single-phase industrial socket-\noutlets or up to 3 three-phase socket-\noutlets. SOA can also have the\ncombination of 3 single-phase socket-\noutlets and 3 three-phase socket-\noutlets.\nThese industrial socket-outlets allow for\nthe connection of portable electrical\nequipment such as electrical hand\ntools, lamps, and water-pumps, etc.\nFig. 1 \u2013 This photograph shows a wall mounted\nThus, it is necessary for each and every\nSOA with uncluttered electrical cables connected\npiece of portable electrical equipment to\nto industrial socket-outlets using industrial plugs.\nbe connected up using only industrial All live parts are fully enclosed.\nplug.

Very often, it was also\nfound that \u2018Do-It-Yourself\u2019 distribution boards (DBs) and extension socket-outlets do not comply\nwith the safety requirements. Such unsafe practices had led to many electrical accidents,\nexamples of which are illustrated by the following case studies.\nA worker was electrocuted when he handled a lit\nspotlight in a building under construction.\nInvestigation into the accident revealed many\nfaults on the electrical installation that supply\nelectricity to the spotlight. This includes\nincorrect connection of wires to the isolator,\nimproper jointing of cables and improper use of\nplugs and socket-outlets. To make matter\nworse, the deceased was working on a wet floor.\nFrom the foregoing case studies, it can be seen that accidents occurred as a result of the\nhaphazard unsafe temporary electrical installations using makeshift DBs, extension socket-\noutlets and cables. Such accidents could be prevented if the SOAs had been used.\n______________________________________________________________________________________\nSafety circular on use of Socket-Outlet Assembly in Construction and Building Sites April 2006 2\nFig. 5 \u2013 This photograph shows a typical wall Fig. 6 \u2013 This photograph shows a typical floor\nmounted SOA. standing SOA\nENCLOSURE\n(cid:153) SOA must be totally enclosed with all live parts\nprotected from direct contact.\nCIRCUIT BREAKERS\n(cid:153) Socket-outlets on the SOA must be\nincorporated with:\n(cid:137) MCBs (Miniature Circuit Breakers)\n\u2013 for overload protection of each circuit in\nSOA\n(cid:137) RCCB (Residual Current Circuit Breaker)\n\u2013 for earth leakage protection\nINDUSTRIAL PLUGS & SOCKET-OUTLETS\n(cid:153) All plugs, socket-outlets and cable couplers shall comply with the requirements of IEC 60309.\n(cid:153) All industrial plugs, socket-outlets and cable couplers must be identified by the colour code given in\nTable 1.\n______________________________________________________________________________________\nSafety circular on use of Socket-Outlet Assembly in Construction and Building Sites April 2006 3\nOperating Colour Examples\nVoltage (V)\n55 White\n110 Yellow\n230 Blue\n400 Red\nTable 1\nPORTABLE ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT\n(cid:153) Flexible cables used for portable electrical\nequipment such as hand-held tools must not\nexceed 3 metres or such other length as\nsupplied by the manufacturer.\n(cid:153) Multiple socket outlet adapters such as that\nshown in Figure 8 do not conform to any IEC\nstandards and shall not be used.

The gondolas moved vertically via\nwinches attached to wire-ropes that are in turned secured to the rooftop of the\nbuilding using a anchorage system. As the gondolas are only designed to move\nvertically, in order to cover the fa\u00e7ade of the building, this means that the\nanchorage point at the rooftop would have to be relocated. Hence it is critical\nthat the integrity of the gondolas and its anchorage is maintained in order to\nprevent the occurrence of accidents.\nKey Learning Points\n3. MOM will like to highlight to the industry three key learning points on the\nsafe use of gondolas.\n(i) Proper design, installation and testing of gondolas\n4. All gondolas and its anchorage system must be designed by a\nProfessional Engineer. The design should be in accordance with established\ncodes of practice and standards. In particular, the design of the gondolas\nespecially its anchorage system need to focus on the following areas:\n1 There were two separate accidents involving the use of gondolas in recent weeks. In the first\naccident on 7 Nov 2009, a worker escaped unharmed when the gondola he was working in tilted.\nA worker was killed in the separate accident on 12 Nov 2009 when he was hit by a piece of falling\nplaster that probably chipped off during the installation of the gondola.\n1\nRef: 20091120-37\na. Where wall clamps are used as part of the anchorage system (refer to\nAnnex C), they must be installed on a structure which is capable of\nwithstanding the stresses imposed on it. Where there is contact\nbetween the clamps (metal) and the wall (plaster) adequate packing\nmust be used. It is also recommended that sufficient clearance be\nmaintained between the wall clamps and other parts of the supporting\nstructure (other than the designated padded areas)\nb. The wire ropes of the gondolas must remain vertical at all times and\nmust not come into contact with any part of the building such as a roof\ncanopy.\nc. Proper entry / exit point into the gondola must be catered for. Workers\nmust be able to climb in and out of the gondola from a secured and\nsafe landing.\n5. The above measures are necessary to prevent accidental dislodging of\nwall materials resulting in falling objects, damage to the wire ropes which can\npotentially destabilise the gondola or even worker falling from height. A pre-\ninstallation site inspection in order to establish the actual condition on site is\nhence critical in order to identify potential problems that may hinder the safe\noperation of the gondolas.\n6. After the design, the gondola can only be erected by an Approved Scaffold\nContractor (ASC) who is responsible to ensure that the installation adhere strictly\nto the design. In addition, the ASC is required to ensure that the gondola is\ninstalled by competent riggers under the supervision of a qualified supervisor2.\nAs part of the installation, the safe working load and number of workers allowed\nwithin the gondola must be clearly specified in order to prevent overloading.\n7. After the gondola has been first installed on site, it must be tested by an\nAuthorised Examiner3 before it is used. The test would include loading the\ngondola with weights to ensure that the gondola can take the load it was\ndesigned for. This test is to be repeated at least once every 6 months thereafter.\n(ii) Regular inspection and maintenance of gondolas\n8. Given the mobility of the gondolas, it is paramount that they are subjected\nto regular inspection and maintenance in accordance to the manufacturer\u2019s\nrecommendation. Measures include the following:\n2 The qualified supervisor is known as a suspended scaffold supervisor as gondolas belong to a\nclass of work platform known as suspended scaffolds.\n3 The Authorised Examiner is a Professional Engineer who is specially approved by the Ministry\nto conduct inspections on lifting machines such as gondolas or cranes.\n2\nRef: 20091120-37\na. The gondola must be re-inspected by the qualified supervisor once\nevery seven days or when the gondola is relocated or if environmental\nfactors (such as heavy storm) may have affected the stability or\nstrength of the gondola.\nb. The winches must be inspected to ensure that the gondola remains\nhorizontal during its ascent or descent. The winches should be\nopened up for a thorough inspection by a competent person at least\nonce every 12 months.\nc. The wire ropes must be inspected to ensure that it is not frayed or\ndamaged.\n(iii) Adequate fall protection measures when using gondolas\n9. Workers working in the gondolas are constantly exposed to the risks of\nfalling from height. Notwithstanding the above measures, adequate fall\nprotection measures must be implemented. The primary control measure is to\nprovide every worker with a safety harness (coupled to a shock absorber) which\nmust in turn be secured to an independent lifeline.\n10. In addition, the Ministry would also like to remind all contractors and\ngondola workers of the following prohibitions:\na. Not to overload the gondola with equipment or materials;\nb. Not to over-stretch by standing on the guardrail of the gondola;\nc. Not to climb out of the gondola unless it is at the designated landing\npoint / level.\nReminder to Industry\n11. Mr Silas Sng, Director, Occupational Safety and Health Inspectorate said,\n\u201cWork involving gondolas present a high level of risk. MOM would like to urge\nthe industry to pay attention to ensuring its safe installation and use. Practical\nguidance can be found in the Approved Code of Practice CP20:1999 \u2013 Code of\nPractice for Suspended Scaffolds and the relevant legislation on suspended\nscaffolds. MOM will be conducting checks on gondolas around the island in the\ncoming weeks. MOM will also be working with the Workplace Safety and Health\nCouncil to alert all Approved Scaffold Contractors on the learning points from the\nrecent accidents.\u201d\n3\nRef: 20091120-37\nAnnex A\nCase 1 \u2013 8 Nov 2006\nThe Deceased and a co-worker were re-positioning a gondola which was resting\non an external cantilevered platform on the ninth storey of a building under\nconstruction. The Deceased was inside the gondola tensioning the cables when\nit tilted outwards. The Deceased fell out off the gondola and struck the ground\n39m below, he died on the spot.\nThe Occupier of the worksite, China Construction (South Pacific) Development\nPte Ltd was fined $130,000 under the Workplace Safety and Health Act for failing\nto take reasonably practicable measures to ensure a safe workplace.\nCase 2 \u2013 3 Apr 2007\nA worker was painting the exterior of a HDB block from a gondola. He climbed off\nthe gondola onto the inclined concrete canopy located on the 10th floor of the\nHDB block, where he fell and landed on the ground. The worker was immediately\nconveyed to the hospital, where succumbed to his injuries.\nThe Employer of the Deceased, Giftbuild Pte Ltd, was prosecuted and fined\n$70,000 for failing to take reasonably practicable measures to ensure the safety\nof its workers. The Giftbuild Director, Goh Eng Ban, was fined $20,000 for failing\nto discharge his responsibilities under the Workplace Safety and Health Act. The\nOccupier of the worksite, Jotun (Singapore) Pte Ltd, was fined a total of $18,000\nfor various violations under the Workplace Safety and Health Act and the\nFactories (Scaffolds) Regulations.\nCase 3 \u2013 12 Nov 2009\nA worker was killed when he was hit by a piece of falling plaster. The gondola\nwas resting on the ground floor and he was most probably tensioning the cables\nin the gondola. Another set of workers were on the roof top installing the gondola\nand the plaster was probably chipped off during the installation process.\nInvestigation is on-going.\n4\nRef: 20091120-37\nAnnex B\nPhoto showing a typical gondola used in painting of a building\nPhoto showing the winches used for the climbing of the gondolas\n5\nRef: 20091120-37\nAnnex C\nDiagram of a typical wall clamp\nSource from CP20: Code of Practice for Suspended Scaffolds\n\u2022\nPoint of anchorage should withstand stress; and\n\u2022\nSecure and adequate packing provided to prevent contact\nwith non-structural elements\n6",

        "content": "MOM / OSHD / 2024-05\n03 Jun 2024\nTrained Air-conditioning Unit Installers;\nAir Conditioning Servicing Contractors; and\nInterested Parties\nCircular on Safety Considerations in Installation and Maintenance of Air-\nconditioning Condensing Units and their Structural-Supporting System\n1. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and the Building and Construction Authority\n(BCA) are jointly issuing this circular to remind all stakeholders responsible for the\ninstallation and maintenance of air-conditioning condensing units (\"air-con units\") and\ntheir structural supporting systems.\n2. Working on externally mounted air-con units are high-risk work at height (\u201cWAH\u201d)\nactivities. In August 2023, an air-con technician tragically fell to his death while\nmaintaining an air-con unit mounted on the exterior of a building. In February 2024,\nanother air-con technician also lost his balance when the structural supporting system of\nthe air-con unit he was working on gave way, narrowly escaping a fatal fall. Further details\nof these incidents can be found in Appendix 1 for reference.\n3. However, incidents of Fall from Height (\u201cFFH\u201d) can be easily prevented with the\nestablishment and implementation of safety measures. This circular emphasises the duty\nof stakeholders to take all reasonably practicable measures to ensure the safety of\nworkers at work and the safety of members of the public who may be affected by the\nwork.\nPre-requisites\n4. Only Trained Air-con Unit Installers (\u201cTAIs\u201d) who have successfully completed the\ntraining course on the installation of a structural supporting system to support an air-con\nunit required by BCA can install air-con unit on the exterior of any building. TAIs must\ncomply with requirements in Part IVA of the Building Control Regulations 2003 (\u201cBC\nRegs\u201d) and ensure that the installed structural support systems (existing or replacement)\ncomply with specifications listed under Part I, II, III or IV of the Seventh Schedule of the\nBC Regs. For Housing and Development Board (\u201cHDB\u201d) properties, the specifications\nand general conditions found in HDB\u2019s InfoWEB must also be complied with.\nSite Preparation and Risk Assessment\n5. Before air-con servicing workers or TAIs commence any work, perform a site-\nspecific risk assessment to identify hazards, evaluate risks, and determine appropriate\nrisk control measures. Implement these measures and ensure that all workers are briefed\nand familiar with them. Measures must be adopted to ensure that the structural supporting\nsystems would not be overloaded during work.\n6. Air-con servicing workers must look out for obvious signs of deterioration (such as\nloosened bolts and nuts, badly corroded brackets and misalignment or dislodgement) on\nthe structural supporting systems. If any of such signs is observed, TAIs must be engaged\nto inspect and rectify or replace the structural supporting systems before air-con servicing\nwork can be carried out. Please refer to Appendix 2 for examples of deterioration.\n7. Establish cordons around all work zones and affected areas at ground level to\nrestrict access to individuals not involved in the works. This includes areas where objects\nhave the potential to fall and cause injury. For examples of area cordoning, please refer\nto Appendix 3.\nFall Prevention Management\n8. Whenever possible, do not carry out WAH activities on top of the air-con units\nand/or its structural supporting systems.\n9. When WAH is unavoidable, it is essential to consider fall arrest measures for\nworkers. Ensure that secure anchor devices are installed. For examples of fall arrest\nmeasures, please refer to the information provided in Appendix 4.\n10. In addition to having the necessary physical controls, it is crucial to ensure that\nworkers carrying out WAH activities receive adequate training and supervision:\na) Deploy only trained workers who have received trade-specific training and have\nsuccessfully completed the relevant WAH courses acceptable to MOM. You\nmay refer to Appendix 5 for information on accredited WSH courses and\ntraining providers.\nb) Appoint a competent person to provide thorough supervision for the workers,\nensuring they are not exposed to hazards and that all necessary precautions\nare taken in situations where there is a risk of falling; and\nc) Ensure adequate supervision especially when workers are new, inexperienced,\nand unfamiliar with the working environment.\nPost-installation\n11. TAIs must submit a report of the installation works no later than 14 days after\ncompletion to the Commissioner of Building Control:\na) For private properties, submit Form AC-01 to BCA; or\nb) For HDB properties, submit Form AC-02 to HDB via e-feedback form at\nwww.hdb.gov.sg/efeedback .\nThe forementioned forms with submission instructions can be retrieved from BCA\u2019s\nwebpage on air-con units safety indicated in Appendix 5.\n12.

        "content": "20110812-42\nDate: 12 Aug 2011\nAll Owners of Jack-In Piling Machines\nAuthorised Examiners (Lifting Equipment)\nAll Piling Contractors, and\nOther Interested Parties\nSAFETY CIRCULAR ON THE USE OF HYDRAULIC JACK-IN PILING (\u201cJIP\u201d) MACHINES\nIn June 2011, a worker was crushed to death by counterweights which had accidentally\ntoppled over from a Hydraulic Jack-in-Piling (\u201cJIP\u201d) Machine. Investigations revealed that the\ncounterweights were not secured to the piling machine. This circular serves as a reminder to duty-\nholders of their statutory duties under the Workplace Safety and Health Act (WSH Act) with regards\nto ensuring safe use of such machines at workplaces. It also highlights the other common workplace\nhazards associated with the safe use of such JIP machines.\nRegistration of Hydraulic Jack-in-Piling Machines as Lifting Machines\n2. The Ministry noted that some of these JIP Machines used at worksites were not registered\nas Lifting Machines with the Ministry. The WSH Act Section 4(1) defines \u201clifting machine\u201d to include\n\u2013 (a) any crane, crab, winch, teagle, runway, transporter, piling frame or piling machine. Since the\nJIP machine is used to install piles for foundation work, it is classified as a piling machine. It follows\nthat such JIP machines are deemed as a statutory lifting machine under the said Act.\n3. Hence, under Regulation 21(1) and 21(3) of the WSH (General Provisions) Regulations, an\noccupier has to ensure that the JIP Machine used in the workplace has to be registered with the\nMinistry as a statutory lifting machine and thoroughly examined by an Authorised Examiner at least\nonce every year.\n4. In addition, Regulation 21(15) of the WSH (General Provisions) Regulations imposes duty on\nthe Authorised Examiner to issue and sign a certificate, in a form determined by the Commissioner,\nof the result of the examination conducted on the JIP Machine. For the purposes of this requirement,\nAuthorised Examiners are reminded to use the form stipulated by the Commissioner provided for in\nthe eServices of the Ministry\u2019s webpage, i.e. Lifting Equipment Class 703, Piling Frame-Hydraulic\nPiling Machine.\nSecurity of Counterweights to the Machine\n5. In most situations, the JIP Machine has counterweights, stacked up to two or more layers,\ndepending on the capacity required for the piling operations. As such, workers face the potential\nhazards of being crushed by toppling counterweights during its installation, removal of the\ncounterweights and also during its day to day operations and travelling. To prevent such accidents,\n20110812-42\nPPPiiillliiinnnggg CCCooonnntttrrraaaccctttooorrrsss aaarrreee rrreeemmmiiinnndddeeeddd tttooo iiimmmpppllleeemmmeeennnttt cccooonnntttrrrooolll mmmeeeaaasssuuurrreeesss tttooo eeennnsssuuurrreee ttthhhaaattt ttthhheeessseee cccooouuunnnttteeerrrwwweeeiiiggghhhtttsss\naaarrreee ppprrrooopppeeerrrlllyyy ssstttaaaccckkkeeeddd aaannnddd aaadddeeeqqquuuaaattteeelllyyy ssseeecccuuurrreeeddd aaattt aaallllll tttiiimmmeeesss...

Considering the heavy weight of the JIP machine together with its counterweights, the\ncondition of ground where the machine is sited and operated on is a critical safety issue. Piling\nContractors are to ensure that the ground is adequately compacted and levelled and sufficiently firm\nand stable for the siting, operation, and travelling of the JIP Machine. Piling Contractors are also\nrequired to adhere to the JIP Machines Manufacturers\u2019 Specifications or Manuals with regards to\nground condition limits and requirements. This will include aspects on the safety limits on slope or\ngradient of ground conditions permitted for the safe operation of the machines. Where such\ninformation is not available, Piling Contractors are to seek written clarification from the\nManufacturers prior to the use of the JIP Machines.\nWorking at Height\n8. When installing and removing counterweights and fitting the pile to the JIP machine, workers\nare often required to work at heights. As such, they are susceptible to risks of falling from heights.\nFor safe conduct of work, a proper Fall Protection Plan (FPP) must be established and implemented\nand appropriate Fall Personal Protection Measures must be provided to the workers.\nRisk Assessment\n9. Under the Workplace Safety and Health (Risk Management) Regulations, proper Risk\nAssessments shall be conducted to address the safety and health risks posed to any person whom\nmay be affected by the activities in the workplace. In particular, employers have a duty to provide an\neffective management and control system for the use and operation of the JIP machines, including\nthe need to develop and implement a safe work procedure (SWP) for the works. More information\non Risk Assessment can be found at the Workplace Safety and health Council (WSHC) website\nhttps://www.wshc.sg\n10. The above procedure is for your immediate compliance.\nYours faithfully,\nDR LEE HOCK SIANG\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER FOR WORKPLACE SAFETY AND HEALTH\nOCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH DIVISION\nMINISTRY OF MANPOWER\nDate of issue: Classification: Circular No:\n12 Aug 2011 Piling Machines OSHD/SPECS/ESB/LE/02-2011\nOccupational Safety and Health Division\n18 Havelock Rd,\nSingapore 059764\nTel : (65) 64385122\nFacsimile : (65) 63171261\nWebsite : http://www.mom.gov.sg/oshd/\nEmail : mom_oshd @mom.gov.sg",

        "content": "1st October 2012\nAll Suppliers, Owners and Users of MEWPs\nAuthorised Examiners and\nOther Interested Parties\nSAFETY CIRCULAR ON SAFE USE OF MOBILE ELEVATING WORK PLATFORM (MEWP)\nThe Ministry of Manpower (MOM) observed that there has been a rise in the use of Mobile\nElevating Work Platform1 (MEWP) in workplaces, such as construction worksites for construction\nactivities, public buildings and offices for building maintenance activities, cleaning and painting of\nexternal fa\u00e7ade works, etc. This circular serves as a reminder to duty-holders of their statutory\nduties under the Workplace Safety and Health Act (WSH Act) with regards to ensuring the safe use\nof such lifting platforms at workplaces.\nDesign Codes and Standards\n2. All MEWPs for use in Singapore shall be designed in conformance with internationally\nacceptable design codes and standards. This would include ensuring that the MEWPs are equipped\nwith all the required safety devices and interlocks stipulated by the applicable design codes and\nstandards it is manufactured and constructed to.\nSafety Devices\n3. It has come to MOM\u2019s attention that some safety devices such as safety interlocks and\noutrigger interlocks installed in MEWPs had been intentionally (1) by-passed or overridden during\nits operation or (2) dismantled or removed from the MEWPs. MOM warns all parties that such\npractices are dangerous and unacceptable. MOM reminds all owners of MEWPs and personnel\nengaged in the use of such equipment that it is an offence under the WSH Act to by-pass or remove\nsuch safety devices installed or fitted to the MEWPs. MOM will not hesitate to take stringent\nenforcement action against any person who wilfully bypass or remove such safety devices from the\nMEWPs.\n1\nMobile Elevating Work Platform (MEWP) includes but not limited to the following equipment: Vertical personnel platforms, Boom\nlift, Scissor lifts, Truck mounted, etc\nOccupational Safety and Health Division\n1500 Bendemeer Road #03-02\nMinistry of Manpower Services Centre\nSingapore 339946\nTel : (65) 64385122\nFacsimile : (65) 63171261\nWebsite : http://www.mom.gov.sg/oshd/\nEmail : mom_oshd@mom.gov.sg\n4.

Investigations revealed that the fire was\nlikely due to the ignition of accumulated flammable vapours from a waste oil collection tank within\nthe room.\n2 Days later, another fire incident occurred on 13 March 2023. The fire engulfed an industrial\nbuilding and caused minor injuries to two workers. Investigations indicated that uncontrolled\nelectrostatic discharge had ignited flammable vapours generated during a dispensing process. Both\nincidents were dangerous occurrences that could have caused fatalities.\nStorage of Flammable Liquids\n3 To prevent similar fires, occupiers shall ensure that flammable liquids are kept away from all\nsources of heat or ignition such as hot surfaces, open flames and even equipment that are not suitably\nenclosed to prevent internal sparks from igniting any flammables in the surrounding (see Annex A for\nexamples); and stored in containers made of non-combustible materials of sound integrity, labelled,\nand covered to prevent accidental spills and accumulation of flammable vapours in the workplace (see\nAnnex B for examples).\n4 Effective controls shall also be implemented to mitigate electrostatic discharge. This includes\nthe installation of grounding and bonding systems as well as the conduct of annual continuity tests,\nboth by competent persons1.\n1 Such as licensed electrical workers (LEWs).\nManagement of Flammable Wastes\n5 Flammable liquid wastes, such as petrol collected from vehicle\nrepair/servicing activities, can cause fires and explosions. Motor workshop\noperators, for example, shall identify and ensure that liquid wastes containing\nsuch flammable liquids are stored separately from non-flammable liquid wastes,\nbefore collection by licenced toxic industrial waste collectors (TIWCs). Mixtures\nof flammable liquid waste and liquids shall be treated as flammable liquids unless\nthey have been laboratory-tested as non-flammable and may therefore be\nsubjected to licensing requirements by the SCDF.\n6 TIWCs licensed by National Environment Agency shall be engaged to dispose flammable\nliquid waste or mixtures. A list of TIWCs can be found here or via the QR code.\nOther Control Measures to Prevent Fires and Explosions\n7 There are other control measures for flammable substances that are required to prevent fires\nand explosions in the workplace. Occupiers can refer to the resources listed below, for information\nand practical guidance. Occupiers can also refer to SCDF\u2019s website on Information of Petroleum and\nFlammable Material (P&FM) Storage Licence.\nJAIME LIM\nSHAIFUL HERMAN\nfor Commissioner for Workplace Safety and Health\nfor Commissioner\nOccupational Safety and Health Division\nSingapore Civil Defence Force\nMinistry of Manpower\nMinistry of Home Affairs\nResources\nWSH Guidelines on Flammable Materials, published by the WSH Council\no\nEnvironment Public Health (Toxic Industrial Waste) Regulations\no\nFire Safety Act and Fire Safety (Petroleum and Flammable Materials) Regulations\no\nWSH (Risk Management) Regulations\no\nSS 532: Code of Practice for the Storage of Flammable Liquids\no\nSS 586-1: Specification for Hazard Communication for Hazardous Chemicals and Dangerous\no\nGoods \u2013 Part 1: Transport and Storage of Dangerous Goods\nSS 586-2: Specification for Hazard Communication for Hazardous Chemicals and Dangerous\no\nGoods \u2013 Part 2: Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals\nSS 603: Code of Practice for Hazardous Waste Management\no\nAnnex A \u2013 Store Flammables away from Heat and Ignition Sources\nThe lack of an effective bonding and grounding system can lead to unintended discharge of\naccumulated electrostatic charges during the transfer of flammable liquids.\nUnsealed containers holding flammable liquids are capable of emitting flammable vapours into the\nwork environment.\nWhen flammable vapours meet heat or ignition sources, fires and explosions can occur. Some heat\nor ignition sources include:\n\u2022 Open flames, such as welding, candles;\n\u2022 Sparks and excessive heat from machinery moving parts;\n\u2022 Overloaded power sockets, exposed electrical wires and circuitry.\nAnnex B \u2013 Suitable Storage for Flammable Liquids\nCabinets for flammable substances\nSealed metal drums\nMetal jerry cans",

The\nRegulations require that gas cylinders containing corrosive gases be\nexamined or tested at least once every 2 years whilst those containing other\ngases be examined or tested at least once every 5 years.\n3 Occupiers, gas suppliers or manufacturers carrying out gas filling must\nensure that both the filling gases, as well as gas cylinders, are free from\ncontaminants that could pose safety and health risks to users. Medical oxygen\nand breathing air supplied in cylinders must meet established standards, such\nas BS EN 12021 or equivalent. Furthermore, additional tests on medical\noxygen or breathing air gas samples taken from the cylinders are to be\nconducted after the filling process to verify that the contents meet the\nintended specifications.\n4 Singapore Standard CP 12 \u201cCode of Practice on the filling, inspection,\ntesting and maintenance of containers for the storage and transport of\ncompressed gases\u201d specifies, among other things, the pre-filling inspection\nprocedures and filling procedures. In the case of oxygen or air cylinders, the\npre-filling inspection procedures of the standard require that the cylinders be\nblown down to atmospheric pressure to remove any contamination.\nRef: 20110425-39\n5 Gases are to be filled into dedicated gas cylinders to avoid cross-\ncontamination. Where conversion of cylinders for different gas services is\nrequired, occupiers, gas suppliers or manufacturers must ensure that the\nmeasures outlined in the Singapore Standard CP 75 (ISO 11621): \u201cCode of\nPractice for gas cylinders - Procedures for change of gas service\u201d are\nadhered to. For example, when transferring cylinders from an inert to oxidising\ngas service, the standard requires the cylinders to undergo examinations to\nascertain mechanical integrity, material compatibilities and suitability of their\nfittings. In addition, the standard requires visual internal inspections and/or\ncleaning of the cylinders to remove any contaminant.\n6 For your compliance.\nKEVIN TEOH\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER FOR WORKPLACE SAFETY AND HEALTH\nOCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH DIVISION",

        "content": "A joint circular by:\n13 August 2018\nTo Companies and Riders Involved in Delivery Work\nSAFE RIDING FOR DELIVERY WORK\nSafe Use of Motorcycles, Bicycles, Power-Assisted Bicycles and Personal Mobility\nDevices for Work\nOverview\nOver the last few years, we have seen a rapid rise in demand for delivery work,\nespecially in the areas of food and groceries, facilitated by mobile apps. As a result, the\nuse of motorcycles, bicycles, power-assisted bicycles (PABs) and personal mobility\ndevices (PMDs) for delivery has increased exponentially.\n2 Companies facilitating delivery work need to ensure that reasonably practicable\nmeasures are taken for the safety and health of delivery riders. Under the Workplace\nSafety and Health Act (WSHA), these companies may undertake the roles of\nprincipal and/or employer. Please refer to Annex A for details of those specific duties.\nProviding Avenues for Reporting Unsafe Riding\n3 Recent incidents have raised the concerns on the safety of riders and public.\nCompanies facilitating these delivery services and riders have a duty to inculcate safe\nriding habits. Therefore, it is important for companies to monitor the safety performance of\ntheir riders.\n4 One practical way is to provide an avenue for reporting unsafe riding by\nmembers of public. Companies should:\na) Provide riders with a unique identifier that is prominently displayed together with\nany reporting channel (refer Annex B), such as a hotline telephone number or a\nmobile app.\nb) Collect and follow up on feedback.\nc) Maintain records of feedback and follow up actions.\nPlease note that the information provided in this Circular is not exhaustive and is for the benefit of enhancing safety and health. The information provided should\nneither be taken to encapsulate all the responsibilities imposed by law nor as replacement for independent legal advice.\nProviding Riders with Sufficient Instruction, Training and Supervision\n5 Companies should ensure that riders are equipped with relevant information on safe\nriding. These include:\na) Hazard identification and risk control measures (refer to WSHA requirements,\nAnnex A).\nb) Safe riding on public paths (refer to requirements under Active Mobility Act, Annex\nC) and its Code of Conduct.\nc) Safe riding on roads (refer to good habits when riding motorcycles, Annex D).\n6 Companies should also provide their riders with adequate training on safe riding\nthat are readily available, such as:\na) Mobility devices users should attend Safe Riding Programme prior to making any\ndeliveries. This programme is freely available. It is developed by the Land Transport\nAuthority (LTA) and the Singapore Road Safety Council (SRSC).\nb) Motorcyclists should attend defensive driving courses at driving centres.\nResources\n7 For further guidance, companies may refer to the Workplace Safety and Health\u2019s\n\u2018Guide to Safe Riding on Motorcycles, Bicycles, Power-Assisted Bicycles and Personal\nMobility Devices\u2019. There is also information on Singapore Police Force (SPF)\u2019s website\n\u2018Road Safety Tips\u2019 and LTA\u2019s website \u2018Active Mobility Act\u2019.\n8 The Ministry of Manpower may follow-up to engage companies to ensure that the\nvarious requirements were met. Companies also may contact the Ministry for clarification\non providing reporting avenues.\nThis circular is jointly issued by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), the Traffic Police (TP),\nand the Land Transport Authority (LTA).\nFor further information, please contact:\nMinistry of Manpower at mom_oshd@mom.gov.sg for workplace safety and health issues.\nWSH Council at contact@wshc.sg for information and assistance on workplace safety and health.\nTraffic Police at SPF_TP_Feedback@spf.gov.sg for traffic related issues.\nLand Transport Authority at https://www.lta.gov.sg/feedback to submit general feedback to LTA.

The information provided should\nneither be taken to encapsulate all the responsibilities imposed by law nor as replacement for independent legal advice.\nAnnex A \u2013 Safety and Health Duties of Companies Facilitating Delivery Work under\nWorkplace Safety and Health Act (WSHA)\nDuties of Employers and Principals\nEmployers must protect the safety and health of their employees or riders working under\ntheir directions. This duty also extends to persons who may be affected by their\nundertaking. To do so, employers should:\n\uf0b7 Conduct risks assessments to identify hazards in relation to delivery work and\nimplement effective risk control measures;\n\uf0b7 Ensure that adequate safety and health measures are taken for vehicles or mobility\ndevices used for the delivery work;\n\uf0b7 Ensure that riders are provided with sufficient instruction, training and supervision\nso that they can work safely;\n\uf0b7 Develop and implement emergency response procedures and systems.\nA principal is any person or organisation who engages a contractor, such as a self-\nemployed rider, to perform work under a contract for service. The duty of a principal,\nincludes ensuring that contractors have the necessary expertise to carry out the work they\nare engaged for, and have taken adequate safety and health measures. If a principal\ninstructs the contractor on how the work is to be carried out, the duties will include the\nduties of an employer.\nThe WSHA applies to work activities on the road and public paths in the same way as it\ndoes to all other work activities. Companies facilitating delivery work will need to manage\nthe risks to riders, even though the nature of work dictates that riders are mobile and are\nnot confined to a fixed workplace. Effective management of work-related safe riding can\nreduce the risk of injury and work-related ill-health, and sustain a productive workforce.\nRisk Management\nCompanies should have a risk management process to identify and mitigate risks to riders,\nensure proper training, and adopt best practices such as providing incentives for safe\nbehaviour. The risk management process will include:\n\uf0b7 Identify and assess risks\n\uf0b7 Control and monitor the identified risks\n\uf0b7 Take appropriate actions to eliminate or reduce the risks, and\n\uf0b7 Effectively communicate these risks to riders\nPlease note that the information provided in this Circular is not exhaustive and is for the benefit of enhancing safety and health. The information provided should\nneither be taken to encapsulate all the responsibilities imposed by law nor as replacement for independent legal advice.\nAnnex B \u2013 Suggested Approach on How Labels can be Prominently Displayed on\na Food Delivery Bag\nThere are companies that have initiated this practice. One company has used its food\ndelivery bags to prominently display the hotline number for reporting unsafe riding by their\nriders.\nThe label must be in a prominent and readable form. An example of the label is shown\nbelow.\nRider 1234XY\n9123 4567\nReport against\nunsafe riding\n15cm\nCompanies that do not use delivery bags can explore other methods of identification.\nPlease note that the information provided in this Circular is not exhaustive and is for the benefit of enhancing safety and health.

The Factories (Persons-in-Charge)\nRegulations legislates the requirements of the competent persons operating ICEs and SBs. The Factories\n(Certificate of Competency-Examinations) Regulations governs the conduct of examinations and the issuance\nof the lifetime Certificate of Competency (COC) by MOM.\n2 These regulations were first enacted in the 1960s when ICEs and SBs were operated manually. Over\nthe years, manual operations have advanced to the use of automation and monitoring devices to ensure that\nICEs and SBs operate within safe limits. On the regulatory front, since 2006, MOM has also progressed from\nthe prescriptive legislative landscape under the previous Factories Act, to a performance-based regime under\nthe Workplace Safety and Health Act (WSH Act).\nRevocation of the Factories (Persons-in-Charge) Regulations and Factories (Certificate of Competency \u2013\nExaminations) Regulations\n3. Taking the advances in technology and the performance-based WSH Act into consideration, MOM has\nreviewed and will make changes to the regulatory regime governing the safe operation of ICEs and SBs. With\neffect from 18 March 2013, the Factories (Persons-in-Charge) Regulations and Factories (Certificate of\nCompetency-Examinations) Regulations will be revoked. Following the revocation of the two said\nregulations:\nOccupational Safety and Health Division\n1500 Bendemeer Road\nSingapore 339964\nTel : (65) 64385122\nFacsimile : (65) 6535 6726\nWebsite : http://www.mom.gov.sg/oshd/\nEmail : mom_oshd @mom.gov.sg\nPage 1 of 3\ni. MOM will no longer issue or require applications under COC for the following list of competent\npersons:\n\u2022 1st and 2nd Class ICE Driver and 1st and 2nd Grade ICE Engineer,\n\u2022 1st and 2nd Class SB Attendant and 1st and 2nd Grade SB Engineer.\nii. COCs of both ICE and SB previously issued by MOM will continue to be valid till the certificate-holders\ncease active duty at the workplace.\nRequirements for Safe Operations of ICE and SB under WSH Act\n4. The current WSH Act and its subsidiary legislation in place will ensure continued oversight on the safe\noperation of ICEs and SBs at workplaces. Details are as follows:\nFor ICE\n5. Section 12(3) of the WSH Act requires the employer to ensure that his workers have been adequately\ntrained to carry out work safely \u2013 this would ensure that workers are adequately trained to safely operate\nthe ICE.\n\u2022 Training provided by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and his designated Authorised\nDistributors are deemed to meet the regulatory training requirements for workers operating ICE.\n\u2022 On-the-job training (OJT) would also be acceptable if the employer can demonstrate that the OJT is\ncomparable in content and rigor to the training provided by the OEM.\nFor SB\n6. Regulation 28(8) of the WSH (General Provisions) Regulations requires the owner of a SB used in a\nworkplace to ensure that only a competent person who has attended a training course acceptable to the\nCommissioner is allowed to operate the SB.\n\u2022 The types of training courses a person needs to attend before operating a SB would depend on the\nheating surface area of the SB.\n\u2022 The operating requirement based on the heating surface area of the SB and the types of training\ncourses on operation of SB that are acceptable to the Commissioner are given in Annex A.\n7.

All Subcontractors (regardless of\n\u2022 Was being barred under MOM\u2019s DPS level of subcontracting) are required\nbetween the tender closing date to to declare that they have checked\ntender award date (both dates their own appointed subcontractors\ninclusive) against SDQ criteria \u2013 BUS and\nDPS, and verified that they are not\ndisqualified before engaging their\nservice.\nii. If declaration form is used, it must\nminimally include the following\ndetails, and be in such a manner as\nrequired by the Main Contractor:\n\u2022 Unique Entity Number (UEN) of\nthe engaged Subcontractors;\n\u2022 Date of contract agreement;\n\u2022 Records of checks against MOM\nCheckSafe\niii. This declaration form must be\nsubmitted to the Main Contractor,\nand the Main Contractor must\nperform a sample check against\nMOM CheckSafe and maintain a\nrecord of this check.\nIf the Main Contractor is found without\nsuch a system onsite, or if disqualified\nSubcontractors have been hired for the\nproject, the Main Contractor needs to\nrectify this with an action plan. For\nexample, the Main Contractor needs to\nimplement a verification system within a\nstipulated timeframe, including\ninstructing their contractor to terminate\nthe particular disqualified Subcontractor.\n1B(i) Require Main Contractor to identify and At Construction Stage:\nimplement WSH trainings/competencies\nspecific to site activities for construction The Main Contractor must demonstrate\nand construction-related projects > due diligence to GPE by:\n$1mil.\ni.

MOM\u2019s BUS\nii. WSH Technology proposed by\ntenderers, where applicable (e.g.\nbeyond the WSH tech included in\nregulations and contract\nspecifications)\niii. Safety track record (e.g. past\ndemerit points based on GPEs\u2019\nin-house assessment in the past\n2 years)\niv. Safety proposals (e.g.\npreliminary risk assessment with\ncorresponding control measures)\nv. Safety accreditation and awards\n(e.g. WSH Award, BizSAFE\nAwards)\nvi. Other GPE\u2019s in-house safety\nperformance/awards records\nRefer to the revised PQM Framework for\nthe suggested safety-related criteria.\nEnhancement 3: Measures to incentivise good WSH standards\n5. Enhancement 3 aims to strengthen the adoption of WSH Technology, a key enabler\nfor detecting and preventing workplace incidents, and incentivise good WSH\nperformance by awarding WSH Bonus Scheme.\nTable 3: Measures under Enhancement 3.\nS/N Enhancement Guide to implement\n3A Require Main Contractor to adopt At Tender Stage:\nmature WSH technology for construction\nand construction-related projects \u2265 GPEs should include the ePTW and\n$3mil. VST specification in the tender\ndocument, where applicable.\nMature WSH technologies:\n\u2022 Electronic Permit to Work (ePTW) Refer to the Annex B and Annex C for\n\u2022 Vehicular Safety Technology (VST) the ePTW and VST specifications\nrespectively.\nAt Construction Stage:\n5\nS/N Enhancement Guide to implement\nThe Main Contractor should\ndemonstrate their adoption of ePTW and\nVST at their worksite to the GPE.\n3B Require GPEs to include WSH Bonus At Tender Stage:\nScheme for construction and\nconstruction-related projects \u2265 $50mil. For CW01, CW02, ME & CR projects \u2265\n\u2022 Suggested total bonus amount is $50mil, to include the WSH Bonus\npegged at 0.5% of awarded Contract Scheme specification in the tender\nSum, subject to a bonus cap of $1mil. document.\n\u2022 Nevertheless, GPEs have the\nflexibility to amend the total bonus At Construction Stage:\namount and the bonus cap.\nGeneral Principles\ni. GPEs are required to include a\nWSH Bonus Scheme for\nconstruction and construction-\nrelated projects with estimated\nprocurement value \u2265 $50mil, and\nensure that the Contractors\nallocate a portion of the Bonus\nfor rewarding workers.\nii. The total bonus amount is\npegged at 0.5% of awarded\nContract Sum, subject to a bonus\ncap of $1mil. Nevertheless,\nGPEs have the flexibility to offer\na higher total bonus amount\nbeyond the specified cap.\niii. GPEs should establish the basis\nfor payout primarily through an\nassessment of the site's WSH\nperformance. This could involve\nimplementing a monthly or\nquarterly assessment on the\nWSH performance of the site and\npaying a bonus to the Main\nContractor if the site meets the\nassessment criteria for that\nperiod.\niv. To reinforce that good WSH\nperformance is a collective effort,\nMain Contractor should allocate\na portion of the WSH bonus for\nrewarding workers, including that\nof direct and indirect\nSubcontractors engaged by the\nMain Contractor.\n6",

If lifting operations are not properly\nmanaged, this can potentially cause severe impact to both workers and members of the public. However, due\nto space or operational constraints, full extension of lorry crane stabilisers may not always be possible.\nTherefore, this can compromise safety of lifting operations. Stability control system is a proven technology that\ncan prevent toppling of lorry cranes in such situations.\nADVANTAGES OF A STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM\n2 A stability control system is designed to detect the deployment and extension of each stabiliser of a\nlorry crane, subsequently calculating and restricting crane movements within a safe lifting zone. By installing a\nstability control system, the risk of overturning of a lorry crane can be effectively mitigated. This allows for safe\noperations in space-constrained situations with partially extended stabilisers.\nIMPLEMENTATING STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM IN NEW LORRY CRANES\n3 From 1 Jan 2025, the Ministry of Manpower will require new lorry cranes2 registered under the\nfollowing lifting equipment classification codes to be installed with an acceptable type of stability control\nsystem.\ni. 631 Lorry Loader \u2013 Telescopic Boom\nii. 632 Lorry Loader \u2013 Articulating Arm\niii. 633 Lorry Loader \u2013 Telescopic Boom and Articulating Arm\niv. 638 Lorry Loader \u2013 Recovery Truck3\nv. 639 Lorry Mounted Cranes, n.e.c.\nACCEPTABLE TYPE OF STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM\n4 The stability control system installed in new lorry cranes from 1 Jan 2025 shall determine the rated\ncapacity of the crane by continuously monitoring the deployment and extension of every stabiliser, outreach\nand position of the crane. The stability control system shall reduce the rated capacity or stop all manoeuvers\nif stabilisers are not sufficiently deployed, ensuring that the crane remains stable while in operation.\n1 Loader cranes mounted on a vehicle chassis, as depicted in Annex A, are commonly referred to as lorry cranes.\n2 Refers to lorry cranes that are registered for the first time with the Ministry of Manpower. Existing lorry cranes that are\nsubsequently re-registered due to change in ownership are excluded.\n3 Stability control system will be mandatory for recovery trucks only if installed with loader cranes.\n` Ministry of Manpower Occupational Safety and Health Division\nMOM Services Centre, 1500 Bendemeer Road, Singapore 339946 Web www.mom.gov.sg Contact us www.mom.gov.sg/contact Tel 65 6438 5122 Page 1 of 3\nCircular: Mandatory Installation of Stability Control System in New Lorry Cranes\n5 The stability control system shall be factory-fitted by the lorry crane manufacturer or installed by the\nauthorised agent for the respective brand of lorry crane.\n6 Stability control systems that limit or stop crane movements based on crane or vehicle inclination are\nnot acceptable.\nSTABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM FOR EXISTING LORRY CRANES\n7 Owners of existing lorry cranes without a stability control system are strongly encouraged to install an\nacceptable type of stability control system. This is to ensure greater assurance of safe lorry crane operations,\nespecially when stabilisers are partially extended.\nMAINTAINING FUNCTIONALITY AND ACCURACY OF STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM\n8 The stability control system is one of the safety devices installed in lorry cranes. Similar to all other\nsafety devices, it is crucial for the stability control system to be properly maintained and periodically calibrated\nfor safe lorry crane operations.\nSTATUTORY EXAMINATION OF LORRY CRANES\n9 Authorised examiners are required to ensure and indicate that an acceptable type of stability control\nsystem has been installed when registering a new lorry crane from 1 Jan 2025.\nFURTHER INFORMATION\n10 Owners, authorised agents, authorised examiners and relevant interested parties are required to\nexercise all due diligence in ensuring compliance to the above requirements, the Workplace Safety and Health\nAct and its subsidiary legislation.\n11 For queries and clarifications, please contact the MOM Contact Centre at 6438 5122 or\nmom_oshd@mom.gov.sg.\nBERNARD KWOK\nfor COMMISSIONER FOR WORKPLACE SAFETY AND HEALTH\nOCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH DIVISION\nDate of Issue: Classification: Circular No.:\n3 Jul 2024 Lifting Equipment MOM/OSHD/2024-07\n` Ministry of Manpower Occupational Safety and Health Division\nMOM Services Centre, 1500 Bendemeer Road, Singapore 339946 Web www.mom.gov.sg Contact us www.mom.gov.sg/contact Tel 65 6438 5122 Page 2 of 3\nCircular: Mandatory Installation of Stability Control System in New Lorry Cranes\nANNEX A : TYPES OF LORRY CRANES\nLorry Loader \u2013 Telescopic Boom Lorry Loader \u2013 Articulating Arm\nLorry Loader \u2013 Telescopic Boom and Articulating Arm\n` Ministry of Manpower Occupational Safety and Health Division\nMOM Services Centre, 1500 Bendemeer Road, Singapore 339946 Web www.mom.gov.sg Contact us www.mom.gov.sg/contact Tel 65 6438 5122 Page 3 of 3",

        "content": "Circular: Suspension of WSH Training\nMOM/OSHD/2020-04\n22 Apr 2020\nUpdated as on 1 Jun 2020\nTo all Occupiers, Employers, Employees\nTraining Providers, WSH Officers, and Other Interested Parties\nContinued Suspension of In-person WSH Training from 2 Jun 2020\n1. From 2 Jun 2020, Singapore will end the Circuit Breaker and embark on Phase One of re-opening\nbusinesses1. However all in-person WSH training and assessment will continue to be suspended from\n2 Jun 2020 until further notice, as a more cautious approach to minimise physical interactions for higher-risk\nactivities. Only training providers approved and notified by SSG will be allowed to conduct specified courses\nwith Safe Management Measures.\nMandatory WSH Training for Work Permit Holders\n2. Consequent to the above, the mandatory WSH training for work permit holders will continue to be\nsuspended until further notice. This means that new foreign workers (those holding In-Principal Approval IPA)\nwill be able to have their work permit issued even if they did not attend required the WSH training.\n3. For this group of new workers, they can only perform lower-risk activities within the resumed\nbusinesses2 and under the following conditions:\n(a) Be assigned to work with a buddy who has undergone the required WSH training; and\n(b) Be identified prominently as a new worker (e.g. coloured armband).\n4. Similarly, MOM will allow existing work pass holders to renew their work pass without the mandatory\nWSH training. These requirements will apply until the suspension has been lifted, and the worker has attended\nthe required training within three months (extended from one month previously) after training suspension is\nlifted.\nContinuing Development Training or Refresher Training for Competent Persons\n5. All requirements related to continual development training or refresher training for the purpose of\nrenewal of competent persons\u2019 registration will still be suspended. This means that existing WSH officers and\nregistered crane operators will be allowed to renew their registration without the required WSH training.\n6. There are no changes in training requirement criteria for new applications to be a competent person\n(e.g. WSH Officer, registered crane operator). This is to ensure that the approved competent persons have\nthe necessary expertise and competency to carry out their functions and duties safely.\n7. Lastly, we would like to remind all stakeholders especially those resuming business activities to remain\nvigilant and ensure the safety and health of your employees at work.\n1 For information on the phased approach for the re-opening of our economy, please refer to MOH\u2019s website and\nMTI\u2019s website.\n2 For information on resumption of businesses, please refer to https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/\nMinistry of Manpower Occupational Safety and Health Division\nMOM Services Centre, 1500 Bendemeer Road, Singapore 339946 Web www.mom.gov.sg Contact us www.mom.gov.sg/contact Tel 65 6438 5122 Page 1 of 5\nCircular: Suspension of WSH Training\nFrequently Asked Questions\n(A) General\n1. What is the rational to continue suspension of all WSH courses?\nPhase One (\u201cSafe Re-opening\u201d) will be implemented from 2 Jun 2020. As the risk of resurgence in\ncommunity transmission remains high, business activities that carry higher risk will remain closed. As such,\nall in-person WSH training will remain suspended from 2 Jun 2020 to minimise contact between individuals\nso as to reduce the transmission of COVID-19. This is aligned to the Multi-Ministry Taskforce\u2019s\nannouncement on 19 May 2020.\n(B) Employers\n2. Can the company appoint my worker to operate machinery or carry out high-risk work for the first\ntime if he has not attended the required WSH training?\nEmployers have a responsibility under the WSH Act to ensure their workers are provided with sufficient\ninstruction, training and supervision so that they can work safely. This is even more critical during this\nperiod of crisis. Workers who do not have the necessary training to operate machinery or carry out high-\nrisk work safely must not be deployed to carry out such high-risk work.\n3. Will my worker\u2019s work pass be revoked if he cannot go for mandatory training needed for work\npass renewal?\nNo, your existing worker\u2019s work pass will not be revoked, as the mandatory training requirement for work\npass renewal has been suspended until further notice.\nNew workers issued with In-Principal Approval (IPA) Notice from MOM will not be required to attend\nmandatory training for the issuance of their work permit. Workers will be given three months after the lifting\nof training suspension to get their required trades certification.\n4. Can my experienced worker still work, even though his training certification validity has expired?\nYes, the experienced worker can still proceed to work (only if it is one of the businesses allowed to resume\nactivities) as the refresher training requirement has been suspended until further notice.\n5. My First-Aider\u2019s certificate has expired. Can he still perform first-aid if necessary?\nYes, the workplace first aider can still perform his duties during this period when the Occupational First\nAid Course is being suspended. You will not be penalised.\n6. Can I deploy my new worker to work in the construction site/ factory/ shipyard/ chemical plant if\nhe has not completed his mandatory training?\nYes, you may deploy but you are to ensure that the worker only carry out lower-risk activities. In addition,\nthe employer is required to ensure that the new worker:\n(a) Wears a prominent identification e.g. arm band for at least 6 months to indicate that he is a new\nworker;\nMinistry of Manpower Occupational Safety and Health Division\nMOM Services Centre, 1500 Bendemeer Road, Singapore 339946 Web www.mom.gov.sg Contact us www.mom.gov.sg/contact Tel 65 6438 5122 Page 2 of 5\nCircular: Suspension of WSH Training\n(b) Is assigned a buddy to be attached at all time on site. This interim condition will continue until the\nnew worker attends and passes the mandatory training.\nThis is subjected to the workplace being allowed to resume their business activities. Workers will be given\nthree months after the lifting of training suspension to get their required trades certification.\n7. Will the training requirements for new application of WSH licenses be waived?\nThere are no changes in existing training requirements for new application of WSH licenses (e.g. WSHO\nofficer, crane operator, approved scaffold contractor, approved crane contractor).\nThis is to ensure the approved competent persons and WSH service providers have the necessary\ncompetencies to carry out their specified WSH functions and duties safely.\n(B) Employees\n8. Will my work pass be revoked if I cannot attend mandatory training required for work pass\nrenewal?\nNo, your work pass will not be revoked, as the mandatory training requirement for work pass renewal has\nbeen suspended until further notice.\nPlease ignore the requirement in the In-Principal Approval Notice from MOM for you to attend mandatory\nsafety orientation training, as we have suspended the requirement. You will be given three months after\nthe lifting of training suspension to get your required trades certification.\n9. The suspension is affecting my ongoing course, which takes three to six months to complete, what\nshould I do?\nAll ongoing classes will resume once the suspension is lifted. You can contact your training providers for\nmore information.\n10. Can I renew my crane operator registration if I am unable to attend WESCO?\nYes, you will be able to renew your crane operator licence even if you did not attend the WESCO.\nFor crane operators aged 50 years and above, medical examination requirements for registration renewal\nwill also be temporarily suspended. Please refer to MOM website for more information.\n11. Can I renew my WSHO registration if my courses with SDU points are suspended?\nYes, WSHOs will be allowed to renew their registration even if they do not have sufficient SDU points.\nHowever, WSHOs will still need to submit renewal application with other items e.g. WSH employment,\nWSH activities for unstructured SDU points. Please refer to MOM website for more information.\n(D) Training Providers (ATOs and LSPs)\n12. Can we continue to teach the courses if we move the training online to eliminate the need for face-\nto-face interaction?\nMinistry of Manpower Occupational Safety and Health Division\nMOM Services Centre, 1500 Bendemeer Road, Singapore 339946 Web www.mom.gov.sg Contact us www.mom.gov.sg/contact Tel 65 6438 5122 Page 3 of 5\nCircular: Suspension of WSH Training\nThe online learning mode is only allowable for theory-based courses. Online format will not be able to\nreplace courses that involve practical component.\nMOM/WSHC may consider allowing online training to proceed if a proposal is submitted and approved.\n13. Do I need to seek approval if I want to conduct online courses? If yes, whose approval should we\nbe seeking and what would be the procedure (and timeline)?\nMOM/WSHC\u2019s approval is needed for a training provider to proceed to conduct online courses. Please\nsubmit your proposal to wsh_training@wshc.sg for our review.\n14. Will the validity of my ATO/LSP status be extended to cover the period of suspension?\nNo, there will not be an extension to the validity of ATO/LSP status.\n15. Will I continue to be audited by SSG/SAC-CBs during the period of suspension?\nThere will be no physical surveillance audits conducted during the period of suspension.\n16. How do we deal with courses that are affected by the suspension?\nTraining Providers are required to notify all affected trainees of the suspension.\n17. When will the suspension last?\nThe suspension will continue from 2 Jun 2020 until further notice. The lifting of the suspension will depend\non the level of community spread of Covid-19 in Phase One. MOM/WSHC/SSG will provide updates to\ntraining providers from time to time.\n18. Will financial assistance be provided to affected training providers during this suspension period?\nOther than measures announced by the government to support businesses and individuals, there is no\nadditional financial assistance plan that will be provided to training providers.\n19. Will I be able to conduct in-person assessment for WSH Courses taught online?\nIn-person assessment is suspended from 2 Jun 2020 until further notice.\n(E) Certification Bodies accredited by SAC\n20. Do we proceed with the certification and surveillance audits, especially if we could move the\nprocess online?\nAll certification and surveillance audits should be suspended until further notice.\n21. Should we certify new LSPs during this period?\nCertification of new LSPs should be suspended until further notice.\nMinistry of Manpower Occupational Safety and Health Division\nMOM Services Centre, 1500 Bendemeer Road, Singapore 339946 Web www.mom.gov.sg Contact us www.mom.gov.sg/contact Tel 65 6438 5122 Page 4 of 5",

        "content": "Ref: 20121218-53\n18 Dec 2012\nAll practising Designated Workplace Doctors\nDear Doctor,\nREVISION OF LABORATORY REFERENCE INTERVAL FOR\nRED BLOOD CELL ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE LEVELS\n1 Under the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) (Medical Examinations)\nRegulations, workers who use, handle or are exposed to the liquid, fumes or vapour of\norganophosphate compounds are required to undergo pre-placement and periodic medical\nexaminations conducted by Designated Workplace Doctors (DWDs). This includes a clinical\nexamination for effects of exposure to organophosphates (OPs) and a laboratory test for red\nblood cell acetylcholinesterase (RBC AChE) conducted at pre-placement and at 6-monthly\nintervals. A detailed work history should be taken and the emphasis should be on the central\nand autonomic nervous systems during clinical examination.\n2 RBC AChE is a biological indicator of the dose of OP an individual worker is\nexposed to and exposure to OP can depress the levels of RBC AChE. The current reference\ninterval is 15,000 \u2013 24,000 U/L.\n3 Department of Pathology, Singapore General Hospital, has informed the Ministry of\nManpower (MOM) of a change in assay methodology for RBC AChE with effect from 10\nJanuary 2013. Consequently, there will be an update of the reference interval from 15,000 \u2013\n24,000 U/L to 7,700 - 14,600 U/L. (Please see Annex 1).\n4 With the revised assay methodology and reference interval, DWDs would not be able\nto use the test results conducted prior to 10 January 2013 as baseline for comparison. They\nshould instead use the laboratory\u2019s revised lower limit of the reference interval. A new\nbaseline can be established when subsequent tests are conducted.\n5 The index of suspicion for suspected poisoning or overexposure must remain high\nand DWDs are reminded to correlate exposure history with individual symptoms and\ninvestigation results. Please refer to Annex 2 from the WSH Guidelines: Statutory Medical\nExaminations.\nRef: 20121218-53\n6 You may contact Dr Lucy Leong at 6692 5067 or email her at\nLucy_Leong@mom.gov.sg if you need any clarification.\nYours faithfully,\nDr Kenneth Choy\nfor COMMISSIONER FOR WORKPLACE SAFETY AND HEALTH\nOCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH DIVISION\nMINISTRY OF MANPOWER\n(This is a computer generated letter, no signature is required)\nDate of issue Classification Circular no\n18 Dec 2012 Statutory Medical OSHD/SPECS/OM/SME/04-2012\nExaminations\nRef: 20121218-53\nRef: 20121218-53\nAnnex 2\nHealth Effects of exposure to Organophosphates\n(Source: WSH Guidelines - Statutory Medical Examinations)\nMain Industries and Occupations at Risk\n\u2022 Horticulture\u2013gardeners, greenhouse workers;\n\u2022 Agriculture\u2013garden pest control operators, farmers;\n\u2022 Vector control operators;\n\u2022 Formulation and manufacture of organophosphates, e.g., insecticide sprays;\n\u2022 Laboratory workers analysing organophosphates; and\n\u2022 Packing and redistribution of organophosphates.\nNote: Organophosphates may be used in domestic settings\nCommon Organophosphates used in Singapore are:\n\u2022 Basudin 60\n\u2022 Dichlorvos\n\u2022 Dimethoate\n\u2022 Dipterex\n\u2022 Diazinon\n\u2022 DDVP (2,2, Dichlorovinyl 0, 0-Dimethyl Phosphate)\n\u2022 Fenthion\n\u2022 Malathion\n\u2022 Parathion\n\u2022 Rogor\n\u2022 Tamaron\n\u2022 Temephos\n(Note: The list is not exhaustive)\nRoutes of exposure\nWorkers are commonly exposed to organophosphates when they use, handle or are\nexposed to the liquid, fumes or vapour of organophosphate compounds.

These include lifting equipment and some types of\npressure vessels.\n2. This circular serves as a reminder to all Authorised Examiners that using proxies to conduct the\nprescribed tests and examinations of all such equipment for the certification of the equipment is strictly\nprohibited. All such equipment is to be thoroughly examined by the Authorised Examiner himself. The\nMinistry will not hesitate to take stringent enforcement action against Authorised Examiners who use\nproxies for such equipment, which can include initiating suspension or cancellation of the approval given to\nthem as Authorised Examiners by MOM. They may also be prosecuted for offences under the WSH Act and\nits regulations. An offence under Section 53(b) carries a punishment of a fine not exceeding $5000, or\nimprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both.\n3. In addition, Authorised Examiners who fail to exercise all due diligence in making any certification or\nconducting any test of examination of such equipment may also be prosecuted under the WSH (General\nProvisions) Regulations, where they shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $20,000 or to\nimprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both.\n4.

Under the\nguidance of MAST, BCA and MOM have been actively engaging industry stakeholders to\ndevelop targeted measures for the public sector to take the lead in raising the emphasis of\nsafety for both the Main Contractors and all levels of Subcontractors. This would then\nstrengthen WSH ownership and outcomes for the construction sector.\n(1) Harmonised WSH Requirements Across Public Sector Projects\n(1A) Extension of the Safety Disqualification (SDQ) Framework\n3 To align the evaluation criteria and temporarily disqualify contractors with poor WSH\nperformance from participating in public sector tenders, the SDQ Framework was\n1 The tripartite composition of MAST includes Ministry of Manpower, Ministry of National Development,\nMinistry of Sustainability and the Environment, Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Trade and Industry,\nMinistry of Health, Industry Leaders and the labour movement.\nimplemented from 1 Oct 2022.

This will apply to all\npublic sector construction tenders using PQM, under the BCA Construction\nWorkheads (CW01 & CW02), for projects \u2265 $3mil.\nThe current safety-related criteria typically evaluate a contractor\u2019s past safety\nperformance or safety track record. To encourage contractors to consider and\npropose safety enhancements, the scope of the criteria will be expanded beyond\nsafety performance e.g. agencies could require tenderers to submit innovative\nproposals related to WSH. One such proposal could be t o adopt safer\nconstruction methods or deploy WSH technologies to improve risk monitoring\nand WSH outcomes.\nb) For construction and construction-related tenders >$1mil which are not using\nPQM: As there is currently no requirement to evaluate the safety credentials of\nthe tenderers during tender evaluation for projects not using PQM, the minimum\nweightage of 5% for safety-related criteria will be applied to public sector\nconstruction and construction related tenders not using PQM under the BCA\nConstruction Workheads (CW01 & CW02) and Construction Related Workheads\n(ME & CR), for projects > $1mil.\nTable 3: Enhanced safety-related criteria\nS/N Details\nAt Tender Stage:\n1 For tenders called using PQM (i.e. CW01 & CW02 projects \u2265 $3mil), agencies will\nincrease the minimum weightage and expand the scope of the safety-related\ncriteria e.g. to include innovative proposals related to WSH, such as technology\nadoption.\n2 For CW01, CW02, ME & CR tenders not using PQM with value > $1mil, agencies\nwill include safety-related criteria in the tender evaluation criteria with minimum\nweightage of 5% for safety-related criteria.\nFirms can refer to the PQM Framework for the suggested safety-related criteria.\n(3) Measures to Incentivise Good WSH Standards\n(3A) Adoption of Mature WSH Technology\n10 Scope: Main Contractor is required to adopt mature WSH technology to enhance\nsafety and raise productivity on-site for public sector construction and construction-related\nprojects \u2265 $3mil. Refer to Table 4.\n11 The technology should include:\na) Electronic Permit-to-Work System (ePTW) which allows full visibility of ongoing\nhigh-risk activities and identifies conflicting works; and\nb) Vehicular Safety Technology (VST) which detects and manages driver/operator\nfatigue, and minimises potential collisions and accidents.\n12 These requirements are applicable to public sector construction and construction\nrelated tenders under the BCA Construction Workheads (CW01 & CW02) and Construction\nRelated Workheads (ME & CR) for projects \u2265 $3mil.\nTable 4: Adoption of mature WSH technology\nS/N Details\nAt Tender Stage:\n1 For CW01, CW02, ME & CR projects \u2265 $3mil, agencies to include the ePTW and\nVST specification in the tender document.

The rig operator was subsequently\nfound fatally pinned between the backstay support of the piling rig and the pile.\n2. Investigation revealed that in the midst of the pile being driven into the ground, the\nrig operator left the operator\u2019s cabin without engaging the rig\u2019s swing brake. The piling\nrig started to slew on its own due to the slight inclination of the ground. Coupled with\nthe momentum of the hammer strikes and/or the resultant vibrations, the driven pile\nbegan to tilt and eventually broke into three segments. It was most likely that when the\nrig operator realized that the pile was tilting and the rig was slewing, he tried to run back\ninto the operator\u2019s cabin to stop the piling operation. However, before he could make it\ninto the cabin, he was caught between the pile and the backstay support of the rig.\n3. The swing brake, when engaged, would have prevented the rig from slewing\nduring piling operations. Piling contractors, whether as employers or as principals to\nsub-contractors undertaking the piling works, have a duty to ensure the safety of the\nworkers performing the work. All piling contractors are advised to alert all piling rig\noperators, for example, through tool box meetings, assessment of the permit-to-work,\nand training, that they are not to leave their piling rig during operations.\n4.

        "content": "Ref: 2000-11\nDear Sir/Mdm,\nTechnical Advisory For Laundry Factories On The Spontaneous Ignition Of Laundry\nWe have noted that recently there are cases of fires at laundry factories.\nInvestigation has revealed that these fires could probably have been caused by spontaneous\nignition, a result of poor dissipation of heat generated from chemical reactions of chemical\nresidues in the laundry.\n2. This advisory (Annex A) is for persons working in laundry factories. It provides\ninformation on the spontaneous ignition of laundry and the precautions to prevent\nthe occurrence of such incidents.\n3. Spontaneous ignition may occur when heat, combustible material and reactive\nchemicals are present. The ignition can take place over a period of time, ranging\nfrom 3 to more than 57* hours. This implies that fires caused by spontaneous\nignition can occur after working hours.\n4. Laundry factories need to take note of spontaneous ignition as they are always\nexposed to the dangerous combination of heat, combustible material and reactive\nchemicals. In addition, soiled linens can contain all sorts of potentially reactive\nmaterials.\n5. Here are some measures that laundry factories should implement:\na. Inform all workers of the hazard of spontaneous ignition.\nb. Make sure that all the dryers have a cool down cycle long enough to properly\nlower the temperature of the dryer load. Check the temperature settings of\neach dryer on a regular basis.\nc. Maintain dryers regularly to ensure that laundry will not be heated to\nexcessively high temperatures.\nd. Wash items with oily stains thoroughly and use a proper heavy-duty liquid\nlaundry detergent.\ne. Allow enough time for all heat to dissipate before folding or bundling.\nf. Never store bundled or folded laundry in boiler rooms, next to hot water\nheaters, behind dryers, or any areas where the temperature is higher than\nnormal room temperature.\ng. Install smoke detectors (linked to SCDF approved Fire DECAM company)\nwhere bundled or stacked laundry are stored. Ensure effective implementation\nof other emergency measures like fire extinguishers, evacuation route and fire\ndrills.\nh. Never allow large loads to remain in dryers after the drying cycle has ended.\ni. When laundry catches fire, normal plastic laundry carts will melt and the\nflaming liquid plastic can spread the fire.

It provides information on the\nspontaneous ignition of laundry and the precautions to prevent the occurrence of such\nincidents.\nSpontaneous ignition of laundry is not an uncommon hazard in laundry factories, especially\nfor those where substantial quantities of laundry is washed and stacked. It is particularly\ndangerous as it can take place long after the laundry is washed, dried and stacked. Thus, it\nis possible for fire caused by spontaneous ignition to occur after the laundry factory has\nclosed for the day. Often the fire will go undetected and may result in death or serious\ninjuries.\nBelow are two recent cases of laundry factories due to spontaneous ignition of laundry.\nCase 1\nThe fire occurred at the rear of the laundry\nshop where three dryers were located.\nThe area in front of these dryers was used\nfor storage of washed articles like face\ntowels, bath towels, body suits, etc. The\nwashed articles were removed from the\ndryers during the evening and put into\nlarge plastic containers to be folded and\npacked the next day. The fire happened\nafter midnight. SCDF concluded that the\ncause of fire was due to spontaneous\nignition due to heat generated by chemical\nreaction within the towels placed inside\nthe meshed plastic containers.\nCase 2\nA fire broke out at the ground floor of a\nlaundry in the middle of the night. Four\nworkers were sleeping at the second level\nof the factory at the time of the fire. Three\nof them managed to escape by jumping\nout of the window, but one of the workers\nfailed to escape and was killed in the fire.\niii\nRef: 2000-11\nBasic Elements of Fire\nFor a fire to occur, three basic elements must be present:\n\u2022 Any combustible material that would act as fuel for the fire \u2013 most laundry\nmaterials such as linens, towels, blankets, clothing and other fabrics are\ncombustible;\n\u2022 Oxygen surrounding the combustible material to support and sustain the fire; and\n\u2022 Ignition source to provide sufficient heat energy to start the fire.\nWhen the combustible material (fuel) is heated to a certain critical temperature called the\n\u2018ignition temperature\u2019, it will ignite and continue to burn as long as there is fuel, the proper\ntemperature and a supply of oxygen.\nSpontaneous Ignition\nSpontaneous ignition is the occurrence of fire without the application of an external heat\nsource. They can occur in the following forms:\n\u2022 A pile of soiled laundry where the soiling agents are reactive and heat up the fabric\nas a result of the respective reaction processes until ignition takes place.\n\u2022 Washed and dried laundries where there are still remains of oil residues which\ngenerate heat (from exothermic chemical reactions) that is poorly dissipated.\nHeat, combustible material and residual oils increase the possibility of spontaneous\nignition. The residual oils such as vegetable oils, massage oils can self-heat to the point of\nignition. Improper washing practices such as the lack of proper detergent, low water\ntemperature settings and faster wash cycles may not be able to remove these oils in a\nnormal wash. To make matters worse, these washed laundries with residual oils are often\nstacked up after the drying process without adequate prior cooling time. Poor dissipation\nof the inherent heat (from the drying process) and generated heat (from the residual oil\nreactions) could lead to spontaneous ignition.\nAnother possible contributing factor is that soiled laundry is often collected and stored in\ncarts. Washed laundry from the dryer or ironer may also be placed in carts for storage or\ndelivery. Some of these carts are made of plastics which are excellent thermal insulators\nand may hold in the heat generated, an effect similar to that of a large stack or pile of\nlaundry. This increases the likelihood of spontaneous ignition of laundry in the carts.\nFurthermore, when ignition takes place, most plastics can become fuel to further sustain the\nfire.\nControl and Preventive Measures\nHere are some measures that laundry factories should implement:\na. Inform all workers of the hazard of spontaneous ignition.\nb. Make sure that all the dryers have a cool down cycle long enough to properly\nlower the temperature of the dryer load. Check the temperature settings of each\ndryer on a regular basis.\nc. Maintain dryers regularly to ensure that laundry will not be heated to excessively\nhigh temperatures.\niv\nRef: 2000-11\nd. Wash items with oily stains thoroughly and use a proper heavy-duty liquid\nlaundry detergent.\ne. Allow enough time for all heat to dissipate before folding or bundling.\nf. Never store bundled or folded laundry in boiler rooms, next to hot water heaters,\nbehind dryers, or any areas where the temperature is higher than normal room\ntemperature.\ng.

Under WICA 2019, all manual employees, and all non-manual employees earning less than\n$2,600 a month, must be covered by their employer under WIC insurance. Furthermore, all WIC\ninsurance policies that commence from 1 January 2021 must be an approved WIC insurance policy\nissued by an insurer designated by MOM.\n3. WIC insurance is employer-centric. Every employer must maintain their own WIC insurance\npolicy for their employees. The reason for this is to give employers and employees greater assurance\nof insurance coverage. Employer-centric WIC insurance avoids disputes between insurers on which\npolicy should pay out the claims, and facilitates claim resolution and compensation to the injured\nemployee.\n4. We are aware of an existing practice in the shipyard industry, where employers are\ncontractually required by the shipyards to provide WIC insurance coverage beyond their employees,\nincluding but not limited to, the shipyards and their related entities, other shipyard nominated\ncontracts as well as independent contractors.\n5. This practice is not allowed under WICA 2019. Such insurance arrangements constitute an\noffence by the insurers and employers involved. If the shipyards are concerned that all workers on\nthe project may not be covered by WIC insurance, they could contractually require all employers\nworking on the project to maintain their own approved WIC insurance policy for their respective\nemployees.\n6. As for common law coverage, shipyards can continue to contractually require their\ncontractors to provide the relevant insurance coverage for the various other entities, if appropriate.\n7.

How do I get a workplace number for my construction worksite to carry out WSH transactions if\nmy worksite does not need to be registered?\nIf you have already applied for a permit for structural works at the worksite with the Building and Construction\nAuthority (BCA), you will receive a workplace number assigned to your worksite via email.\nIf your worksite does not need a BCA permit, you can log in to WSH e-Service using your company\u2019s CorpPass\nto create a non-notifiable workplace number.\nYou can also log in to WSH e-Service using your company\u2019s CorpPass to search for active workplace records\nunder your company.\nMore information is available at:\nwww.mom.gov.sg/faq/factory-notification-and-registration/how-do-i-get-a-workplace-number-to-perform-wsh-\ntransactions-if-my-worksite-does-not-need-to-be-registered\nMinistry of Manpower Occupational Safety and Health Division\nMOM Services Centre, 1500 Bendemeer Road, Singapore 339946 Web www.mom.gov.sg Contact us www.mom.gov.sg/contact Tel 65 6438 5122 Page 1 of 2\nCircular: Factory Registration Exemption for Construction Worksites\n4. Is my worksite still required to conduct and submit the initial SHMS audit since there is no need\nto register for a Factory Registration?\nConstruction worksites must implement a Safety and Health Management System (SHMS) and conduct SHMS\naudit or internal review as required by Workplace Safety and Health (Safety and Health Management System\nand Auditing) Regulations. Please refer to the new timelines for submission.\nWorksite Conduct SHMS audit or internal review\nWorksite with contract sum $30 \uf0b7 Conduct SHMS audit by SAC-accredited WSH Auditing Organisation\nmillion and above at least once every 6 months.\n\uf0b7 If your worksite has applied with BCA for a permit for structural\nworks, you must conduct SHMS audit within 6 months of their\napproval date.\n\uf0b7 If your worksite doesn\u2019t need BCA permit, you must conduct the\naudit within 6 months of starting operations.\nWorksite with contract sum \uf0b7 Conduct internal SHMS review at least once every 6 months.\nless than $30 million\n\uf0b7 If your worksite has applied with BCA for a permit for structural\nworks, you must conduct internal review within 6 months of their\napproval date.\n\uf0b7 If your worksite don\u2019t need BCA permit, you must conduct internal\nreview within 6 months of starting operations.\n5. Can a worksite have multiple occupiers? For example, are specialist contractors directly\nappointed by the developer allowed to have their own workplace number that is different from\nthe main contractor?\nIn general, there should only be a single occupier holding charge, management and control of a specific\nworksite. Unless there are clear contractual demarcation, the main contractor appointed by the developer will\nremain as the occupier of the worksite.\nSpecialist contractors and other sub-contractors must continue to coordinate with the main contractors to\nensure that any work carried out does not compromise the safety and health of the workers.\n6. Is my existing factory registration valid?\nFor existing construction worksites already registered with MOM, the factory registration remains valid until the\ncontractor terminates the registration upon project completion.\nMinistry of Manpower Occupational Safety and Health Division\nMOM Services Centre, 1500 Bendemeer Road, Singapore 339946 Web www.mom.gov.sg Contact us www.mom.gov.sg/contact Tel 65 6438 5122 Page 2 of 2",

Mandatory SHMS for metalworking factories\nmust be audited based on the revised version from 11 Oct 2022 onwards.\n4. Conduct Audits Professionally and Objectively\na) Auditors must be professional and objective when performing audits. A Code of Ethics provides an\nethical framework for organisation to manage and demonstrate the accountability of the\norganisation to their customers and stakeholders. AOs can take reference from SAC Guidance 01 -\nGuidelines on Code of Ethics, which is meant to complement the integrity and impartiality\nrequirements in SAC CT 17.\nb) MOM recently fined and suspended two auditors for not exercising due diligence when performing\nmandatory audits. They were not physically on site during the audits and they assigned audit scores\neven when there was no evidence to support conformances. SAC also suspended the AO involved\nfor not maintaining a standard of practice that complied with their accreditation criteria SAC CT01A\nand SAC CT17.\nc) MOM and SAC will take stern actions against auditors and AOs who do not conduct audits in a\nprofessional manner. MOM will also take action against Occupiers of workplaces that, where\nrequired, do not engage SAC-accredited AOs to conduct mandatory SHMS audits.\nYours faithfully,\nSEBASTIAN TAN\nfor COMMISSIONER FOR WORKPLACE SAFETY AND HEALTH\nOCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH DIVISION\nMINISTRY OF MANPOWER\nDISTRIBUTION (via email)\n\u2022 Association of Process Industry\n\u2022 Association of Safety Auditing Firms (ASAF)\n\u2022 Association of Singapore Marine Industries (ASMI)\n\u2022 Bedok Safety Group (Manufacturing)\n\u2022 Chemical Industries Employees' Union\n\u2022 Metal Industries Workers Union\n\u2022 Occupational & Environmental Health Society\n\u2022 Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC)\n\u2022 The Singapore Contractors Association Limited (SCAL)\n\u2022 Singapore Chemical Industry Council (SCIC)\n\u2022 Singapore Institution of Safety Officers (SISO)\n\u2022 Singapore Manufacturing Federation (SMF)\n\u2022 Singapore Metal and Machinery Association\n\u2022 Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF)\n\u2022 Society of Loss Prevention\n\u2022 United Workers Of Petroleum Industry\n\u2022 Waste Management & Recycling Association of Singapore (bulk storage of chemicals)\n\u2022 List of SAC accredited WSH auditing organisations and WSH Auditors",

This caused the gatepost\nto topple on another worker, killing him (refer to Annex A).\n2. Mobile concrete pumps often need to be driven and repositioned by pump operators within\nareas such as construction worksites and factories, but many of the operators do not possess Class 5\ndriving licenses. This is of great concern to MOM, especially in view of the increase in workplace\nvehicular fatalities.\nSCAL-SSDCL Driving Training for Pump Operators\n3. To address the issue, MOM collaborated with the Singapore Contractors Association Ltd\n(SCAL) and the Singapore Safety Driving Centre Ltd (SSDCL) to develop a one-day structured training\ncourse with both theory and practical components that is focused on the safe driving of truck-\nmounted concrete pumps on non-public roads. This course is known as the SCAL-SSDCL Driving\nTraining for Pump Operators.\n4. This circular serves to inform all truck-mounted concrete pump operators driving or\nmanoeuvring concrete pumps in construction worksites and/or factories (non-public roads) must\nsuccessfully complete the above course by 31 Jan 2023 unless they possess a Class 5 driving license.\n5. Upon passing the driving training course, the trainee will be issued with a certificate of\ncompletion. This certificate will have a validity of 5 years, which can be renewed by attending a\nrefresher course.\n6.

Designated traffic routes should be clearly marked with\ntraffic and safety signs. Road humps may be created to reduce traffic speed especially in\nareas where pedestrians are expected.\n\u2022 Place company vehicles under a routine inspection and maintenance regime.\n\u2022 Confirm each company driver has a valid licence for the class of vehicle that he/she will\ndrive. Only licensed drivers trained for the specific make and model of the vehicle may\noperate them.\n\u2022 Equip traffic controllers with brightly coloured reflective vests so that they are highly\nvisible to drivers.\n\u2022 Advise workers to keep a lookout for traffic and always maintain a safe distance from\nmoving vehicles.\n\u2022 Consider the use of technology to improve and/or monitor vehicle safety, such as\ncollision sensors, blind spot cameras, reversing alarms and speed limiters.\n* Information on the accident is based on preliminary investigations by the Ministry of Manpower as at\n21 September 2021.

An AE\nmust be a Professional Engineers (PE) and approved by the Commissioner for Workplace Safety and\nHealth to carry out inspections of these statutory equipment. Applicants for AE must meet the\nfollowing criteria:\na. PE in the field of Mechanical Engineering with a valid Practising Certificate issued by\nProfessional Engineers Board (PEB) and;\nb. At least 5 years of experience in the relevant field, e.g. Pressure Vessel (PV) or Lifting\nEquipment (LE); and\nc. Familiar with the relevant codes and standards, as well as the inspection criteria for the\nequipment.\nApplicants will need to pass an interview conducted by MOM.\nPEB\u2019s Specialist Professional Engineer (SPE) scheme\n2. PEB registers engineers as PE in the branches of civil engineering, mechanical engineering or\nelectrical engineering. In addition, PEB maintains a scheme where PEs practicing in specific areas\nwould be required to be registered as Specialist Professional Engineer (SPE). To be a SPE, a PE\nwould have to submit an application to PEB and undergo a peer evaluation of his competency. SPE\nare regarded to have higher level of engineering knowledge in that specific field of work.\n3. From 1 Jan 2017, PEB will introduce 4 new SPE branches, namely, Lift and Escalator\nEngineering, Crane Engineering, Access Platform Engineering and Pressure Vessel Engineering. This\nis in addition to the existing scopes of Geotechnical Engineering and Amusement Ride Engineering.\nDate of issue: Classification: Circular No:\n18 Nov 2016, amended 28 Nov 2016 Authoris ed Examiner OSHD/ SPECS/ESB/AE/01-2016\nPage 1 of 7 Information accurate as at 28 Nov 2016\nAlignment of MOM AE Registration Framework to SPE Scheme\n4. With the introduction of the new SPE branches, MOM will recognise SPE in the relevant\nbranch as qualified to be an AE in the corresponding field of work. From 1 Jan 2017, all new AE\napplicants must be registered as a SPE in the relevant branch. In view SPEs from these branches are\nassessed to be equipped with the knowledge and skills to carry out specialised engineering work\nsuch as testing and examining of pressure vessels or lifting equipment, they may be approved by the\nCommissioner for WSH without the need for further assessment. The mapping of the SPE branches\nto the approved equipment that AE can test and examine is in Annex A.\n5. Existing AEs must be registered as SPE in the relevant branch by 31 Dec 2017.

        "content": "Ref: 20050823-26\nCircular for Swimming Pool Owners and Operators\nDear Sir/Madam\nIncident of chlorine gas release\nRecently, there was an incident involving chlorine gas release from the pump\nroom at a local swimming pool. Staff and patrons within the vicinity had to be\nevacuated and some were sent to hospitals for treatment of nausea and irritation of\nthe nose and throat. Investigations revealed that the release of chlorine gas was a\nresult of a worker accidentally mixing two incompatible chemicals \u2013 sodium\nhypochlorite and hydrochloric acid in the dosing tanks. This circular is issued to you\nto take measures to ensure that a similar incident does not occur at your premises.\nStorage and handling of chemicals\n2. Chlorine-containing chemicals are commonly used in swimming pools as part\nof the routine water treatment. While such chemicals help to disinfect the water, care\nmust be taken to ensure that they are used in a safe manner as improper storage\nand handling of these chemicals may result in spills and release of chlorine gas.\n(Chlorine gas can irritate our eyes and lungs. Inhalation of chlorine in higher\nconcentrations may result in choking sensations, vomiting, chest pain and difficulty in\nbreathing.)\nSafety and security measures\n3. The National Environment Agency (NEA), Ministry of Manpower (MOM),\nSingapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) and Singapore Police Force (SPF) would like\nto advise swimming pool operators and owners, who use chlorine-containing\nchemicals (such as sodium hypochlorite) for disinfection, and acids (such as\nhydrochloric acid) for pH adjustment of the pool water, to take the following\nmeasures.\nSafety measures\na. Inlet couplers used for loading sodium hypochlorite and hydrochloric\nacid should be of different sizes or shapes and properly labeled.\nb. All pipings should be correctly labeled.\nc. Chlorine-containing chemicals (sodium/calcium hypochlorite, sodium\ndi/trichloroisocyanurates, sodium chlorate, sodium chlorite or others)\nare incompatible with acids and shall be stored separately with\nadequate segregation and measures to prevent accidental mixing.\nBund walls or kerbs should be erected for liquid chemicals to contain\nany spill or leak\nd. The inventory of swimming pool water treatment chemicals should be\nRef: 20050823-26\nkept to a minimum.\ne. All chemical containers should be labeled to indicate the identity of the\nchemicals, the hazards involved and the precautions to be taken.\nf. Only trained workers should be allowed to handle chemicals. They\nmust be educated about the hazards involved and the precautions to\nbe taken. Such instructions on safe handling of the chemicals can be\nfound in the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) of the respective\nchemical - provided by the manufacturer or the supplier of the\nchemical.\ng. Chemical storage / pump rooms should be well ventilated. Flooding\nand seepage of rainwater in these rooms should be prevented, since\nwater may come in contact with the chemicals and trigger reactions\namong the chemicals.\nh. Loading of swimming pool water treatment chemicals and preparation\nof dosing chemicals should as far as possible be carried out during\nnon-peak hours.\nSecurity measures\ni. Blind flange or caps secured with a padlock or other secured devices\nshould be installed at the inlet of the chemical loading lines. The keys\nshould be kept by authorized persons.\nj. Only authorized staff is allowed to access the chemical storage / pump\nroom.\nk. The doors to the chemical storage / pump room should have a double\nlocking system. If the door has only one locking device, an additional\nlatch-padlock device is to be fitted onto the door.\nl. A proper key management system to the chemical storage / pump\nroom should be established to ensure that the movements of keys are\nproperly recorded and accounted for. E.g., procedures on key\nissuance, reporting loss of keys, keys register book etc.\nm. Any chemical refilling activity must be supervised by the facility\nmanagement staff.\nn. Swimming pool owners / operators are advised to install a CCTV\ncamera to monitor access into the chemical storage / pump room, for\ndeterrence and detection of suspicious activities. The images captured\nby the CCTV camera should be recorded so that it can be used for\ninvestigations.\n4.

It is critical that lifting personnel, such as the lifting supervisors and crane operators, are\nable to read and understand the load charts and operation manuals to ensure proper planning and\nsafety in lifting operation.\n2. Owners of mobile or tower cranes are reminded that every mobile or tower crane must be\nprovided with the load chart(s) and operation manual (both written in English) and these are kept in\nthe operator\u2019s cabin. An owner has also to arrange for the load chart(s) and operation manual to be in\nother language understood by the crane operator if he/she does not understand English.\n3. The Ministry has also observed that some owners do not have properly documented\nmaintenance and operation logs/records for their mobile or tower cranes. Regn 21(16)(b) of WSH\n(General Provisions) Regulations requires the owner of a mobile or tower crane to ensure that it is\nproperly maintained. In addition, regns 16(g) and 16(h) of the Factories (Operation of Cranes)\nRegulations require the crane operator to record operational tests and incidents of failures or\nmalfunctions in the crane\u2019s log book or sheet.\n4. To comply with these requirements, all owners must have such maintenance and operation\nlogs1 for every mobile or tower crane and keep them available for inspection. The maintenance\ncarried out on a mobile or tower crane must be in accordance with manufacturer\u2019s instructions and\nproperly documented in the log. Operation logs shall indicate the heaviest load lifted, cycles of lift and\nhours of operation of the crane on a daily basis. (see attached Annex for an example of an operation\nlog)\n5. From 1 Jan 2010 onwards, all Authorised Examiners would be checking for compliance of the\nabove during the statutory inspections of the tower and mobile cranes.\nYours faithfully\nCHAN YEW KWONG\nfor Commissioner for Workplace Safety and Health\nDate of issue: Classification: Circular No: 032-004-00001\n18 Nov 2009 General Policy OSHD/ LE 1/09 Page 1 of 1\nNote 1: Electronic data logging is considered as acceptable means for recording of\noperation logs\nRef: 20091118-36\nAnnex\nSample Operation Logs\nDaily (To be kept for a minimum of 6 months)\nYear Month Day Load, kg Cycles Crane Operating Crane IC / WP no.\nHours Operator\n2009 Sept 25 500-1000 12 9am \u2013 10am, ABC S7654321A\n2pm-4pm\n26 300-1000 6 9am \u2013 11am ABC S7654321A\n27 600-1000 7 2pm-4pm DEF S7891011D\n28 500-1200 13 9am \u2013 10am, ABC S7654321A\n2pm-4pm\n29 500-1200 13 9am \u2013 11am, ABC S7654321A\n2pm-5pm\n30 500-1000 13 9am \u2013 11am, ABC S7654321A\n2pm-5pm\nOct 1 300-3000 11 9am \u2013 10am, DEF S7891011D\n2pm-4pm\n2 300-3000 10 9am \u2013 10am, DEF S7891011D\n2pm-4pm\n3 600-1000 5 2pm-4pm DEF S7891011D\nTotal 90\nCumulative Monthly (To be kept for Life Extension)\nYear Month Load, kg Cycles\n2009 June 100-1100 373\nJuly 200-2000 287\nAug 300-3000 176\nSep 300-1200 322\nOct 300-3000 26",

The\nworker was pronounced dead at the scene of the accident.\n2 When carrying out lift maintenance or repair works, stakeholders are reminded to\nadopt the necessary measures to ensure the safety of workers and prevent similar accidents\nfrom recurring:\nA) Reminder to Lift Owners\nEnsuring Safety of Lift Technicians and Provision of Safe Lift Maintenance Environment\n3 The lift owners should ensure that the lift maintenance environment is safe, conducive\nand healthy for work, and that the lift contractor has the necessary expertise to carry out the\nwork and has taken adequate safety and health measures. This includes ensuring that\npersons carrying out the work have sufficient experience and training to carry out the work\nsafely and that site-specific risk assessments have been conducted.\nB) Reminder to Employers and Principals\nRisk Assessment, Safe Work Procedures and Emergency Response\n4 Under the Workplace Safety and Health Act, employers and principals shall conduct a\nrisk assessment in relation to the safety and health risks posed to any person who may be\naffected by the lift maintenance or repair works undertaken at the workplace, and implement\nthe necessary safe work procedures (SWP) to control the risks. The SWP shall include the\nassessment of position of the lift car for safe access and conduct of work. The SWP shall also\ninclude inspection of the lift car top controls to ensure that it is functioning properly before\ncarrying out any work on the lift car top. Throughout the duration when work is being carried\nout on the lift car top, lift car movement shall only be controlled by the workers on the lift car\ntop using the car top controls.\n5 A communication protocol must be established to ensure proper and clear\ncommunication between the workers on the lift car top, and the supervisors and other workers\ninvolved in the work. This is to avoid any miscommunication between the workers and the\ncarrying out of incompatible or unauthorised works.\nMinistry of Manpower Occupational Safety and Health Division\nMOM Services Centre, 1500 Bendemeer Road, Singapore 339946 Web www.mom.gov.sg Contact us www.mom.gov.sg/contact Tel 65 6438 5122\nBuilding and Construction Authority\n52 Jurong Gateway Road #11-01 Singapore 608550 Web www1.bca.gov.sg Feedback https://www.bca.gov.sg/feedbackform/ Tel 1800 3425222 Page 1 of 2\nCircular: Safety of Workers during Repair or Maintenance of Lifts\n6 Employers and principals are also required to work with lift owners to establish and\nimplement an Emergency Response Plan for dealing with emergencies relating to lift\nmaintenance work, such as worker entrapment. All necessary rescue equipment shall be\nmade readily and easily available, and persons appointed to carry out emergency response\nmust be trained and competent and able to respond quickly when called upon.\nC) Reminder to Workers\nGood Practices for Lift Maintenance Work\n7 Workers carrying out lift maintenance or repair works must adhere strictly to the SWP\nor safety rules implemented at the workplace. They shall also not endanger themselves or\nothers who are working around them by exhibiting any unsafe behavior or committing any\nunsafe act.\n8 When working within the hoist-way, such as in the lift pit or on the lift car top, workers\nshould be aware of surrounding structures which may pose as potential crushing hazards.\nThis include ensuring that the body (including hands, elbows, feet and head) is within the\nperimeter of the lift car top.\n9 For more information on ensuring workers safety during lift maintenance or repair\nworks, you may wish to refer to the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Guidelines on\nWorking Safely During Maintenance on Electric Passenger and Goods Lifts:\nhttps://www.tal.sg/wshc/Resources/Publications/WSH-Guidelines/WSH-Guidelines-on-\nWorking-Safely-During-Maintenance-of-Electric-Passenger-and-Goods-Lifts\nER.

The medical\nexamination includes a laboratory test for red blood cell acetylcholinesterase (RBC AChE).\n2 The RBC AChE test requires the use of reagents produced by Roche Diagnostics Asia\nPacific Pte Ltd. We have been informed by Roche that they have ceased production of the\nreagents in August 2022 (refer to Annex 1). We have checked and found that there are no\nother alternative reagents for the test. This means that the testing for RBC AChE would not\nbe available once the existing stock of reagents runs out. Therefore, we will suspend the\nrequirement for testing of RBC AChE with effect from 1 March 2023.\n3 We will continue to maintain the testing for butyrylcholinesterase (serum\ncholinesterase)1 as part of pre-placement medical examinations, and the clinical examinations\nby DWD as part of the 6 monthly medical examinations for effects of OP exposure. You are\nstill required to submit the Summary Report to MOM.\n4 If poisoning or overexposure to OP is suspected, please refer the worker to the\nEmergency Department for further management immediately. Persons diagnosed with OP\npoisoning, an occupational disease, must be notified to MOM via iReport\nwww.mom.gov.sg/ireport.\n5 Copies of the Summary Report of Examinations and relevant test results should be\nkept for at least 5 years. Employers are to continue to keep a list of workers who are exposed\nto OP (a register of employees), which need not be submitted to the Ministry of Manpower.\n6 Employers are also reminded to ensure that adequate control measures are in place,\nsuch as engineering control measures, safe working practices and use of appropriate personal\nprotective equipment.\n1 Please refer to Annex 2 for the list of local laboratory providers for butyrylcholinesterase (serum cholinesterase)\n1\n7 Please contact the MOM Contact Centre at 6438 5122 or email\nmom_oshd@mom.gov.sg if you have any clarifications.\nYours faithfully,\nMs JAIME LIM\nfor COMMISSIONER FOR WORKPLACE SAFETY AND HEALTH\nOCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH DIVISION\nMINISTRY OF MANPOWER\nDate of issue: Classification: Circular no:\n30/01/2023 Workplace Health MOM/OSHD/2023-01 (revised)\n(Date of revision: 03 Jun 2024)\n2\nAnnex 1 Marketing notification from ROCHE Diagnostics Asia Pacific Pte Ltd\n3\nAnnex 2 List of local laboratory providers for butyrylcholinesterase (serum\ncholinesterase)\nLaboratory Contact Details\nInnoquest Diagnostics 6235 6950\n6275 5501\nNational University Hospital (NUH) Department of 6778 5171\nLaboratory Services\nParkway Laboratory Services 6278 9188\nResteLab 6229 6031\n6214 4220\nSingapore General Hospital (SGH) Pathology Lab 6321 4950\nServices 6326 5353\n4",

They bridge\nWSH directives from the management to workers, and see to the implementation and compliance with WSH\npractices. It is thus imperative that they undergo continuous training to build up their competencies to assist\nthe occupier in managing workplace injury risks.\n2. The WSH Act requires the Employer and the Principal to take reasonably practicable measures to\nensure the safety and health of the workers. This includes providing these workers with adequate training for\nthem to perform their work. MOM requires <Name of Company>, as the Occupier and Principal/Employer, to\nsend all the appointed WSH Coordinators working in your construction worksites to undergo the WSH\nCoordinator Refresher Training. These include the WSH Coordinators employed by the contractors and sub-\ncontractors who are working in these worksites.\n3. WSH Coordinators are required to complete the refresher training by the following deadlines:\na. All WSH Coordinators in the construction sector who were trained before and on 31 December\n2017 will have to complete their refresher training by 30 June 2023;\nb. All WSH Coordinators in the construction sector who were trained from 1 Jan 2018 till 31 Dec\n2021 will have to complete their refresher training by 31 Dec 2023.\nPriority for registration will be given to WSH Coordinators who are working in construction worksites where the\ncontract sum is less than $10 million, and those who need to meet the earlier deadline.

Who are required to attend the WSH Coordinator Refresher Training?\nConstruction companies (referring to both occupiers, and sub-contractors) are required to send WSH\nCoordinators they employ to go for the refresher training.\nThis refers to all workers who are playing the role of a WSH Coordinator regardless of whether they\nare appointed within or outside the regulatory requirements.\nFor workers who have completed the Advanced Certificate in WSH (Level B), but are not yet\nappointed as WSH Coordinators, they are not required to attend the refresher training, but we\nencourage companies to send their workers for the training if there are plans to deploy these workers\nas WSH Coordinators in future.\nPractising WSH Coordinators who hold the Safety Coordinator Training Course (SCTC) certificate\nwill also be required to attend the refresher training.\nIf a worker has been registered with MOM as a WSH Officer, then he/she need not attend the WSH\nCoordinator Refresher Training.\n2. When do the WSH Coordinators need to attend the WSH Coordinator Refresher Training?\nThe Construction Companies or their WSH Coordinators can sign up with either of the training\nproviders who offer the refresher training starting from 1 January 2023.\na. All WSH Coordinators in the construction sector who were trained before and on 31\nDecember 2017 will have to complete their refresher training by 30 June 2023;\nb. All WSH Coordinators in the construction sector who were trained from 1 Jan 2018\ntill 31 Dec 2021 will have to complete their refresher training by 31 Dec 2023.\n3. How can a WSH Coordinator benefit from attending the Refresher Training?\nThe refresher training comprises (a) asynchronous e-learning (estimated 5 hours) and (b) a one day\nin-person training after the learner has completed the e-learning. It would provide updates on WSH\ndevelopments, and covers useful and relevant topics including good WSH practices and effective\nmanagement of contractors. There will be activities for participants to apply their knowledge and\nskills to practical work scenarios. It is a good platform for practising WSH Coordinators to learn from\none another through sharing and active participation in the learning activities conducted during the\none-day physical workshop.\nMinistry of Manpower Occupational Safety and Health Division\nMOM Services Centre, 1500 Bendemeer Road, Singapore 339946 Web www.mom.gov.sg Contact us www.mom.gov.sg/contact Tel 65 6438 5122 Page 4 of 5\nCircular: WSH Coordinator Refresher Training\n4. How to enroll for the training?\nEither the company or individual learners can apply to either of the two training providers below to\nsign up for the refresher training:\nNTUC Learning Hub SCAL Academy\nHotline Number 63365482 67939020\nRegistration\nQR Code\nThere is a need to provide a separate email address account for each participant to register and\ncomplete the e-learning. Please contact the training provider for assistance should you encounter\ndifficulties in creating an email account, or in registering for the course.\n5. What are the assessment criteria?\nLearners must complete the 10 e-learning modules and answer the online quiz questions correctly,\nbefore they can proceed to join in the one day in-person training. There is no limit to the number of\nattempts they could take to pass the online e-learning quizzes.\nThe in-person workshop relies on teaching and discussion to impart the content. There will be no\ntest or exam for the in-person workshop. All learners who complete the e-learning and the in-person\nworkshop would receive a Certificate of Participation. The certificate will be valid for two years.\n6. Will there be official records to verify a WSH Coordinator has attended the WSH\nCoordinator Refresher Training?\nResults of learners who have successfully completed the WSH Coordinator refresher training would\nbe uploaded by the training providers to MOM\u2019s WSH Training Record System (link). The certificate\nwould be valid for two years. WSH Coordinators are required to attend the next refresher training\nbefore the expiry of the current training certificate.\nMinistry of Manpower Occupational Safety and Health Division\nMOM Services Centre, 1500 Bendemeer Road, Singapore 339946 Web www.mom.gov.sg Contact us www.mom.gov.sg/contact Tel 65 6438 5122 Page 5 of 5",

It has come to our notice that some owners of mobile cranes have been replacing the\nprime mover/truck chassis of their cranes. This has resulted in an old crane/new chassis\ncombination. Even with a new chassis, such crane is still deemed an old crane and will be\ntreated as such by our department.\n3. It has also come to our notice that some Approved Persons have approved such\ncranes (ie. those referred to in para 2) and used the date of first registration of the new\nvehicle/prime mover/chassis of the truck with LTA as the date of first use of the crane. This\nis not acceptable to our department. The date of original manufacture of the crane should\nbe used. We would like to remind Approved Persons to stop such practice.\n4. Approved Persons are requested to be vigilant when inspecting such cranes and\nascertain the correct date of first use of the mobile cranes as defined above.\nDate of Issue Classification: Circular No: CIF A32.4.1\n18 July 2003 Mobile Crane OSD/ ENG CIR / LE 3/03 Page 1 of 2\n5.

In the interim period, various stakeholders\nhave the responsibility to ensure that operations, maintenance, repair and decommissioning works\ninvolving HC refrigerants are safe.\n2 Since the initial circular was issued by SCDF in December 2011, there have been incidents\ninvolving HC refrigerants with two of the incidents involving casualties. The first accident involved a\ncase of flash fire when air-con servicemen were carrying out decommissioning work, resulting in one\nfatality and two workers injured. In the second accident, HC refrigerant leaked from an AHU during\nnormal operation and resulted in a flash fire. Two workers were injured in this accident\n3 In the wake of these accidents, we would like to remind stakeholders to take actions to\nensure the safety and health of all those who might be affected.\nFlammable Hazard of HC Refrigerants\n4 HC refrigerants pose a fire and explosion hazard in addition to those of conventional\nrefrigerant. Workers who are not familiar with the aforesaid hazard may treat HC refrigerants in the\nsame way that they handle conventional, non-flammable refrigerants. Inappropriate handling could\nresult in the formation of a flammable atmosphere, which can escalate into a fire or an explosion.\nMeasures to mitigate risks associated with HC Refrigerants\n5 Companies handling HC refrigerants should adopt necessary measures, including the\nfollowing to reduce the risks associated with HC refrigerants:\na) Ensure that workers handling HC refrigerants are fully aware of the fire and\nexplosion hazard and the resulting consequence.\nb) Ensure that workers are able to identify the type of refrigerant in the refrigeration\nsystem and its associated hazards via Safety Data Sheets.\n1:SCDF Circular, Review on Use of Hydrocarbon Refrigerant in Singapore, 06 December 2011\nPage 1 of 3\nRef: 20140220-65\nc) Develop and implement measures to prevent fire/explosion, which should include:\ni. Removal or prevention of accumulation of HC refrigerant\nii. Exclusion or effective enclosure of possible sources of ignition\niii. Use of suitable flame-proof equipment\nd) No welding, brazing, soldering or cutting operation should be conducted on any\nsystem that contains or has contained HC refrigerants until all reasonably practicable\nsteps have been taken to safely remove the HC refrigerant and the system has been\ncertified by a competent person to be free of HC refrigerant. Any certificate issued\nby the competent person should be kept available at all times for inspection.\ne) HC refrigerant shall be kept, handled and disposed of in a safe manner as not to\npose a risk to the safety and health of any person who may be affected.\n6 Occupiers currently still using HC refrigerants should implement measures including, but not\nlimited to:\na) Disseminate adequate information on the hazards of HC refrigerant, including Safety\nData Sheets.\nb) Display adequate warning notices specifying the flammability hazard of HC\nrefrigerants at all entrances of any workroom containing HC refrigerants as well as all\nappropriate locations.\nc) Ascertain that the contractors engaged to handle refrigeration systems containing\nHC refrigerants:\ni. Have sufficient expertise to carry out the work involving HC refrigerant.\nii. Have taken adequate safety and health measures regarding work involving\nHC refrigerants, including the conduct of risk assessments.\nd) Provide adequate ventilation to prevent HC refrigerant accumulation when HC\nrefrigeration systems are located indoors.\ne) Remove all potential sources of ignition from areas where there is possible HC\nrefrigerant accumulation.\nPage 2 of 3\nRef: 20140220-65\n7 For clarifications, please contact Soh Zi Quan at soh_zi_quan@mom.gov.sg or Ng Geok Meng\nat ng_geok_meng@SCDF.gov.sg\nGo Heng Huat COL Francis Ng\nfor Commissioner for Workplace Safety and Health for Commissioner for Singapore Civil Defence Force\nOccupational Safety and Health Division Hazmat Department\nMinistry of Manpower Ministry of Home Affairs\nDate of Issue Classification Circular No.\n20 February 2014 Fire and Explosion OSHD/SPECS/MHI/PS/02-2014\nPage 3 of 3",

        "content": "23 July 2015\nOSHD/SPECS/MHI/PS/01-2015\nCircular on the Hazards and Controls of Combustible Dusts\nCombustible dusts are fine particles that present an explosion hazard when\nsuspended in air under certain conditions. Examples of combustible dusts are:\nCategory Powders or Particles\nOrganic Matter Sugars, Corn Starch, Flour, Charcoal, Coal, Peat, Soot, Cellulose Pulp\nAdipic Acid, Ascorbic Acid, Sodium Ascorbate, Calcium Acetate, Calcium\nChemicals Stearate, Sodium Stearate, Lead Stearate, Dextrin Lactose, Methyl-\ncellulose, Paraformaldehyde, Sulphur.\nMetals Aluminium, Bronze, Magnesium, Zinc, Iron Carbonyl.\nPolymers e.g. Polymethylmethacrylate, Polyacrylamide, Polyacrylonitrile,\nPlastics\nPolyethylene, Polyvinylchloride, Resins, Melamine.\nDust Explosions\n2 A dust explosion is the rapid combustion of fine combustible dust particles\nsuspended in air, often but not always in an enclosed location. A mass of solid combustible\nmaterials will burn relatively slowly due to the limited surface area exposed to the air.\nHowever, when the same solid is divided into fine powder and dispersed as suspended\nparticles in air in the form of dust cloud, the result will be quite different. In this case, the\nsurface area exposed to the air is much larger, and if ignition occurs, the whole of the cloud\nmay burn very rapidly. This results in a rapid release of heat and gaseous products, causing\npressure to rise.\n3 Dust explosions can occur when all five elements in the dust explosion pentagon are\npresent as shown below:\nFuel (Combustible dust)\nIgnition Source Air\nDust Explosion\nPentagon\nConfinement Dispersion\nPage 1 of 3\nControl Measures\n4 To prevent dust explosions, workplaces can remove one or more elements from the\npentagon and consider control measures in this order:\n(i) Eliminate combustible dusts;\n(ii) Provide controls to minimise the risk;\n(iii) Provide supplementary controls to mitigate the consequences.\n5 Many products are handled as fine powders but there are occasions where granular\nor pasty products can be used with advantage. The risk of an explosion may also be\neffectively eliminated if the quantity of dust present is sufficiently small.\n6 Some control measures for dust explosion risks can include, but are not limited to:\nDust Control\n\u2022 Well-designed and well-maintained local exhaust ventilation (LEV) systems can\ncapture dusts effectively to prevent unnecessary dispersion of combustible dusts\nwhere people are at work. For loading, unloading or conveyance of materials, LEV\nsystems can be implemented at suitable locations, taking care to not to have an\nextensive ducting network, which can cause burning materials to spread following\nan explosion within the LEV system.\n\u2022 Implement suitable housekeeping and maintenance programmes for dust\ncollection system and filters. Vacuuming or wet cleaning methods are preferred\nover sweeping methods, as sweeping would tend to cause more dispersion of\ndust particles.\nIgnition Control\n\u2022 Use suitable flame-proof equipment or non-sparking tools in areas handling\ncombustible powders.\n\u2022 Effective bonding and grounding of powder handling units to prevent the\naccumulation of electrostatic charges, which can be a source of ignition when\ninadvertently discharged. Regular continuity testing should be carried out to\nensure the effectiveness of bonding and grounding.\n\u2022 Inert atmospheres within powder handling units to eliminate the possibility of an\nignition. For example, nitrogen can be used to reduce/eliminate the presence of\noxygen in the atmosphere of the containment. Oxygen analysers can be employed\nto ensure the effectiveness of the inert gas blanketing.\nPage 2 of 3\nExplosion Relief and Venting\n\u2022 Provide explosion relief vents of suitable sizing at the right locations for powder\nhandling units to safely vent the energy in the event of a dust explosion. To\nprotect persons at work, explosion relief vents must be located or positioned\naway from work areas, walkways etc.\n\u2022 Install detectors for sparks or glowing materials within equipment such as\ngrinders, LEV ducting. An interlock could be added to extinguish potential ignition\nsources or stop further conveyance before sparks or glowing materials reach\nother parts of the workplace.\n\u2022 Separate areas handling combustible dusts from other parts of the workplace\nwith distance or isolate units with barriers (e.g. chokes, baffles and isolation\nvalves).\nTraining and Awareness\n\u2022 Provide training and refresher courses on combustible dust hazards and its\ncontrols for persons involved in work with combustible dusts.\n\u2022 Communicate clearly the combustible dust hazards and its physical properties,\nsafe handling practices and precautions to be taken.\nPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE)\n\u2022 Workers working with combustible dusts should be equipped with the necessary\nPPE. For example, fire retardant clothing, static dissipative safety shoes etc.\n7 For more recommendations on how to manage combustible dusts safely, workplaces\ncan refer to:\n(i) UK Health and Safety Executive\u2019s Guide on Safe Handling of Combustible Dusts.\n(ii) NFPA 654, Standard for the Prevention of Fire and Dust Explosions from the\nManufacturing, Processing, and Handling of Combustible Particulate Solids.\n(iii) WSH Council\u2019s Workplace Safety and Health Guidelines on Flammable Materials.\nIssued by:\nOccupational Safety and Health Division\nMinistry of Manpower\nDate of Issue Classification Circular No.\n23 July 2015 Process Safety OSHD/SPECS/MHI/PS/01-2015\nOccupational Safety and Health Division\n1500 Bendemeer Road #03-02\nSingapore 339946\nFacsimile : (65) 6535 6726\nWebsite : http://www.mom.gov.sg/\nEmail : mom_oshd@mom.gov.sg\nPage 3 of 3",

It supersedes the joint circular\nissued by MOM, NEA, SCDF and SPF on 19 July 2011.\nStorage, handling and disposal of chemicals\n2. Chlorine-containing chemicals are commonly used in swimming pools as part of the routine water\ntreatment. While such chemicals help to disinfect the water, care must be taken to ensure that they are used in\na safe manner as improper storage and handling of these chemicals may result in spills and release of chlorine\ngas. Chlorine gas can irritate our eyes and lungs, and inhalation of chlorine in higher concentrations may result\nin choking sensations, vomiting, chest pain and difficulty in breathing. Care must also be taken to ensure that\nchemicals are not illegally disposed of into the sewerage system.\nSafety and security measures\n3. The National Environment Agency (NEA), PUB, Singapore\u2019s National Water Agency, Ministry of\nManpower (MOM), Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) and Singapore Police Force (SPF) would like to advise\nswimming pool operators and owners, who use chlorine-containing chemicals (such as sodium/calcium\nhypochlorite) for disinfection, and acids (such as hydrochloric acid) for pH adjustment of pool water, to\nimplement the following measures where relevant.\nSafety measures\n(1) Risk assessment has to be conducted for the work activities carried out at the swimming pool premises,\nincluding the hazards of the chemicals handled within the premises and the precautionary measures to be\ntaken when handling chemicals.\n(2) Safe work procedures should be established and documented to facilitate swimming pool operations in a\nsafe manner. The procedures must include but not limited to the following:\na.

        "content": "GUIDE TO LOCAL FABRICATORS OF PRESSURE VESSELS\n1 Introduction\nRecently a fatal accident occurred in a factory in Singapore where a pressure\nvessel that was undergoing a pneumatic test using nitrogen gas, exploded.\nThis Guide is specifically prepared to highlight the safety issues involved to the\nmanufacturers that fabricate and test pressure vessels.\n2 What is a pressure vessel?\nA pressure vessel is a container, a tank or a vessel, which is subjected to an\ninternal pressure higher than atmospheric pressure during use.\nThe vessel may, while it is subjected to the internal pressure, be holding or\ncontaining any substance either in the form of a gas, a liquid or a powder.\n3 Why is a pressure vessel potentially hazardous?\nA pressure vessel is a potentially hazardous piece of equipment as it is under\npressure and it may fail without warning during tests or use.\nAny design or fabrication fault or misuse of the vessel could lead to an\nexplosion. A number of such explosions have occurred around the world\n(including Singapore) causing extensive damage to buildings, properties and\nconsiderable loss of human life. Therefore, it is essential that the design,\nfabrication and use of these pressure vessels be stringently controlled in order\nto ensure that they are safe for use.\n4 How to assure safe design, fabrication, tests and inspections of pressure\nvessel?\nThe following considerations are necessary to assure the safe design,\nfabrication, tests and inspections of a pressure vessel:\n(a) Design\nThe pressure vessel should be designed to an approved code. The\ncode will specify the requirements for design, manufacture, tests and\ninspection of the pressure vessel. The code therefore serves to ensure\nthat the pressure vessel to be fabricated has been adequately designed\nto serve its purpose.\n(b) Fabrication\nThe pressure vessel should be fabricated in accordance with the design\ncalculations and drawings, and the method of construction as stipulated\nby the approved code.\nWhere welding is involved, the welding procedures and specifications\ndescribed in the code for the pressure vessel should be followed\nstrictly. It is also necessary to ensure that the welders tasked to carry\nout the welding of pressure vessel are competent to carry out the type\nof welding required by the design code.\nOSD Guide 1.0/July 2002\nA competent inspector should be engaged to survey the fabrication of\nthe pressure vessel to assure that it complies with the design\ncalculations and drawings, and the method of construction stipulated by\nthe approved code.\n(c) Tests and Inspections\nTests and inspections form a very important part of the process of\nmaking sure that the pressure vessel fabricated can withstand the\npressure and temperature to which it will be subjected.\nWhere required, non-destructive tests such as dye penetrant tests and\nradiographic tests could be carried out on the welds to detect cracks\nand other defects.\nPressure tests of the vessel should always be conducted using water\n(hydrostatic test) or an incompressible liquid (hydraulic test). It is not\nrecommended that air or any other gas be used for pressure tests. This\nis because air/gases are highly compressible and could result in an\nexplosion in the event of a rupture during the tests.\n5 Conclusion\nPressure vessels are potentially hazardous equipment and should be\ndesigned and fabricated to an approved code.\nPressure tests of a pressure vessel should be carried out using water or an\nincompressible fluid.\nThe factory occupier and the employer have to draw up safe work procedures\nfor the fabrication and testing of pressure vessels. They have to ensure that\ntheir workers are briefed on these procedures and trained to deal with the\nhazards arising from the hazardous processes in the course.\nNote: The above serves only as a general guide to safe design, fabrication, tests and inspections of\npressure vessel. It is recommended that reference be made to the relevant codes for specific\ndetails.\n2",

In view of\nthe difficult situation, we will be granting a 6-month extension to the certificate of statutory testing and\nexamination for Lifts, Hoist and Lifting Platform (below):\nLift (LL) Hoist (LH) Lifting Platform (LP)\n101 \u2013 103 & 109 201 \u2013 203 & 209 801-806\n2 This will apply to equipment with certificate of expiry between 7 April 2020 and 6 October 2020 (6\nmonths from the start of the circuit breaker). As an illustration, if the certificate had expired in April 2020, the\nequipment will have to be re-examined by an Authorized Examiner by October 2020, even though we had\nearlier granted a 2-month extension due to the circuit breaker. Effectively, this means that the certificate will\nhave a validity period of 12 months instead of the usual 6 months for these classes of equipment. This will\nalso apply to new equipment of the same classes registered during this period.\n3 In lieu of the statutory inspections, owners of these Lifting Machines are required to appoint a\ncompetent person to conduct an in-house inspection and examination of the Lifting Machines to ensure that\nthe equipment can continue to be operated safely during the extended period. The inspection and examination\nshall be documented into a report or certificate which shall be kept at the workplace and produce for inspection\nupon request by a MOM Inspector. Owners of these Lifting Machines are also reminded to take all necessary\nmeasures and precautions, including the conduct of proper risk assessments and implementation of robust\nmaintenance regime, to ensure that the Lifting Machines can continue to be operated safely during the\nextended period.\n4 For further information, you may contact MOM at mom_oshd@mom.gov,sg.\nER.

It is not uncommon to\nconduct 3,000 tonnes pile load tests utilising the concrete-blocks Kentledge method. At such\nload, in terms of magnitude and the large number of concrete-blocks needed, the design and\ninstallation of Kentledge structure would need special attention. In addition, greater care and\nconsideration will be required during the various stages of the pile testing, ie. planning, setting\nup, testing and removal phases. It is also noted that the setting-up and dismantling of concrete-\nblocks Kentledge structure is not only time consuming but is also labour intensive. The storage\nand transportation of large numbers of concrete-blocks are also costly. Such method of testing\npiles is not only unproductive but also poses higher level of safety risk to workers.\n2. With the increased risks associated with large concrete-blocks Kentledge\ndesigns, alternative pile load testing methods should be considered. Such methods\ninclude \u201cbuilt-in load cell\u201d test, or using tension piles or ground anchors or steel-plate Kentledge\nas a reaction. For example, the deployment of \u201cbuilt-in load cell\u201d pile testing is more productive\nas it requires less manpower to set up and dismantle. Although they may cost more, piling\ncontractors who can show a 20% productivity improvement by using such alternative methods\ncan consider applying for the BCA Productivity Improvement Project (PIP) fund to help defray\ncosts when using such alternative methods. Please note that the adoption of these methods\nshall comply with the relevant codes of practice such as SS CP4:2003.\nLessons Learnt from Kentledge Failure Incident\n3. On 16 Jan 2011, during a pile load test at a construction worksite, the steel structural\nframe supporting a Kentledge structure tilted, causing the concrete blocks to fall beyond the\nworksite boundary onto a public road. Fortunately, no one was injured in the incident. The\nincident resulted in the closure for several days of the affected road in order for the blocks to be\nremoved safely. Investigations revealed that the failure of the Kentledge structure was mainly\ndue to inadequacies in the design of the foundation supporting the Kentledge structure.\nDate of Issue Classification Circular No: ME045\n4 Apr 2012 Piling OSD/Kentledge Page 1 of 3\nRef: 20120405-46\nRequirement under WSH (Construction) and WSH (RM) Regulations\n4. We wish to remind all piling contractors of the legal requirements under the Workplace\nSafety and Health (WSH) (Construction) and WSH (Risk Management) Regulations :\na. The testing of piles in a worksite shall be conducted under the direct supervision\nof a designated person1.\nb. Effective measures shall be taken to warn persons not to approach the pile test\narea in a worksite. No person shall be allowed to approach a pile test area in a\nworksite while the process of increasing or decreasing test loading is being\ncarried out unless under the specific instruction of the designated person.\nc. It shall the duty of the designated person to take, so far as is reasonably\npracticable, such measures as are necessary to ascertain that the pile testing\nsystem in a worksite is in a stable condition and is safe for approach.\nd. Risk Assessment shall be conducted to address the safety and health risks\nposed to any person who may be affected by the pile load testing activities in the\nworkplace, and the risks identified shall be eliminated through reasonably\npracticable steps.\ne. Where it is not reasonably practicable to eliminate the risk referred to in\nparagraph (d), reasonably practicable measures to minimise risk, and safe work\nprocedures to control the risk, shall be implemented.\nGuidelines for Pile Load Test Using Kentledge Method\n5. To guide the industry in Kentledge Method, in Feb 2011, BCA and MOM together with\nLTA, HDB, ACES, IES, SCAL, and major piling specialist builders formed a Workgroup to draft\nthe \u201cGuidelines for Pile Load Test Using Kentledge Method in Singapore\u201d, under the\nchairmanship of Geotechnical Society of Singapore (GEOSS). The Guidelines, published in Sep\n2011, cover recommendations on safety factor for allowable bearing capacity for Kentledge\nfoundation, minimum distance from neighbouring structures, differential settlements of\nKentledge base, height to width aspects ratio of the Kentledge setup, site supervision by\ncompetent staff, instrumentation and monitoring of the Kentledge setup. BCA and MOM will like\nto urge all the stakeholders of the construction industry to adopt the Guidelines for pile load test\ncarried out using Kentledge method.

Over the past week, two formwork collapse accidents took place at separate construction\nworksites (refer to Annex A for details on the two accidents). While the investigation into these\naccidents are in progress, preliminary findings showed that the formwork structures gave way during\nthe concrete casting process, indicating that the structures were unable to support the load imposed\non them during the casting process. Although it was fortunate that there were no serious injuries\narising from these accidents, such dangerous occurrences could have catastrophic consequences\nand result in significant loss of lives.\n3. General duties of stakeholders are imposed under the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH)\nAct while more detailed provisions on the design, construction, and safe use of formwork structures\nare regulated under the WSH (Construction) Regulations 2007. MOM takes a firm stance against any\ncontraventions of the WSH Act and its subsidiary regulations, and will like to remind PEs involved in\nformwork-related activities to pay particular attention to the following:\nDesign of Formwork Structures\n\uf0a7 If appointed to design any formwork structure, the PE should ensure that he is appointed in\nwriting with a detailed documentation of the PE\u2019s work scope;\n\uf0a7 PE shall comply with Part IX of the WSH (Construction) Regulations 2007, and make\nreference to the Singapore Standard 580:2012 (or any revision thereafter) and the various\nformwork guidelines published by WSH Council;\nOccupational Safety and Health Division\n1500 Bendemeer Road\n#03-02 MOM Services Centre\nSingapore 339946\nTel : (65) 6438 5122\nFacsimile : (65) 6535 6726\nWebsite : http://www.mom.gov.sg/oshd\nEmail : mom_oshd@mom.gov.sg\n\uf0a7 All formwork structures shall be capable of sustaining the total dead load, live load and impact\nload imposed on the formwork structures with a minimum safety factor of 2;\n\uf0a7 PE shall ensure that his design of the formwork structure can be executed safely by any\nperson who constructs or uses the formwork structure according to his design;\n\uf0a7 If the PE\u2019s design comprises any proprietary formwork system, the PE should obtain the\nmanufacturer\u2019s manual which contains instructions on the safe use of the formwork and\nensure that he is competent in the use of the proprietary formwork system, before\nincorporating the proprietary formwork system in his design; and\n\uf0a7 Mix-and-match of formwork systems and components should be avoided. Should this be\nunavoidable, PEs shall ensure that the design for the entire combined formwork structure\ntakes into consideration the compatibility of these systems as well as the overall strength and\nintegrity of such systems. The PE\u2019s design and calculations shall be documented.\nInspection of Formwork Structures\n\uf0a7 Before issuing a certificate to state that the formwork structure is safe for its intended use\n(hereinafter referred to as \u201ccertificate for safe use\u201d), the PE should ensure that a site\ninspection is conducted jointly with the competent site personnel, e.g. site engineer/ formwork\nsupervisor, to ensure that the formwork structure is constructed in accordance to the PE\u2019s\ndesign and safe for its intended use;\n\uf0a7 PE should keep records of the inspections, such as location plans (indicating the inspection\nareas) and photographic records of the inspected formwork structure. These records should\nbe kept and be produced for inspection upon request by a MOM inspector;\n\uf0a7 PE\u2019s inspection shall include verification that all components required by the PE\u2019s design are\nnot omitted, under-provided, substituted or deviated (e.g. dimension);\n\uf0a7 PE shall ensure that the horizontal and diagonal bracings are provided in both longitudinal\nand transverse directions, as may be necessary to provide stability and rigidity to any\nformwork structure unless the formwork structure has been designed to be stable and rigid\nwithout the bracing;\n\uf0a7 Any deviation to the PE\u2019s design must be rectified to the PE\u2019s satisfaction before the PE\nissues the certificate for safe use; and\n\uf0a7 The certificate for safe use issued by the PE should cover the entire formwork structure to be\nused for concrete work, including the formworks, falseworks, shores, and any other support.\nPenalty for Contravention of Requirements on Formwork Safety\n4. Any PE who violates the Workplace Safety and Health Act (Chapter 354A), under Section 13\n- Duties of Self-Employed Persons and Section 15 - Duties of Persons at Work, shall be liable to a\nfine of up to $200,000 and / or imprisonment of up to two years.

        "content": "Circular: Do not Bypass or Override Safety Devices of Mobile Cranes\nMOM/OSHD/2019-03\n22 Nov 2019\nDo not Bypass or Override Safety Devices of Mobile Cranes\nIt has come to MOM\u2019s attention that some safety devices such as overload, hook over-hoist, boom over-hoist or\nover-lowering limiter installed in Mobile Cranes1 had been intentionally bypassed or overridden without proper authorisation\nduring lifting operation. MOM warns all parties that such practices are dangerous and unacceptable. MOM reminds all\nCrane Operators, Lifting Supervisors, occupiers, owners of Mobile Cranes, and personnel involved in lifting operation that\nit is an offence under the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Act to bypass or override such safety devices without proper\nauthorisation. MOM will not hesitate to take stringent enforcement action against any person who wilfully bypass or override\nsuch safety devices on Mobile Cranes.\nImplementation of Authorisation System for Overriding of Safety Devices\n2 This circular calls for the implementation of the following Authorisation System for overriding of safety devices on\nMobile Cranes excluding Lorry Loaders:\n\u2022 For Mobile Cranes with key-operated bypass switches, the bypass keys shall be kept within an access-controlled\narea by an authorised person at all times during lifting operations. Any request for use of the bypass key shall be\nassessed and permitted only after prior approval is granted by the authorised person.\n\u2022 For Mobile Cranes with non-key-operated bypass switches or keys that cannot be removed from the switches,\nthe bypass switches shall be enclosed within a secure housing that can be locked. The key to this lock shall be\nkept within an access-controlled area by an authorised person at all times during lifting operations. Any request\nfor use of the key shall be assessed and permitted only after prior approval is granted by the authorised person.\n\u2022 Crane Operators shall ensure that all bypass switches are set to the \u201coff\u201d position at the start of each work-shift,\nor before access to the bypass switches has been locked out; and\n\u2022 Lifting Supervisors shall check and ensure that all bypass switches in Mobile Cranes are set to the \u201coff\u201d position\nat the start of each work-shift.\nActive Monitoring of Data Logger Reports for Unsafe Acts\n3 Occupiers, crane owners and employers are strongly encouraged to review the data logger reports regularly to\nmonitor and assess the lifting operations for any anomaly or unsafe situation. If an unsafe act or non-compliance involving\nthe overriding of safety device(s) is detected, the occupiers, crane owners or employers shall conduct an investigation and\ntake necessary remedial actions to prevent recurrence.\nDuty-holders to Ensure Safe Operation of Mobile Cranes\n4 MOM would like to remind all persons, including Crane Operators, that the activation of any bypass switch in\nthe crane to override safety devices during lifting operations and for lifting of loads beyond the safe working load\nof the crane are strictly prohibited. Under Regulation 21(7) of the Workplace Safety and Health (General Provisions)\nRegulations, lifting appliances and lifting machines can only be loaded beyond their safe working loads when directed by\nan Authorised Examiner or an inspector for the purpose of testing such lifting appliance or lifting machine.\n5 The above circular is for immediate compliance.\n1 Mobile crane means a crane mounted on a truck, crawler or on wheels and includes any crane of a type shown in the First Schedule of the Workplace\nSafety and Health (Operation of Cranes) Regulations 2011.\nMinistry of Manpower Occupational Safety and Health Division\nMOM Services Centre, 1500 Bendemeer Road, Singapore 339946 Web www.mom.gov.sg Contact us www.mom.gov.sg/contact Tel 65 6438 5122",

        "content": "Ref: 20120301-44\n1 March 2012\nSliding Gate\nDesigners, Manufacturers, Installers and Contractors and\nInterested Parties (See Distribution List)\nCircular on Safety Considerations in Gate Design and Operation\nThis circular serves as a guide to all the parties involved in the design, manufacture,\ninstallation and operation of residential and industrial gates.\n2. Four accidents occurred in 2011 that involved the toppling of sliding gates at entrances to\nbuildings. One worker was killed while four others were injured in the accidents. Details of the\naccidents are appended in Appendix 1 for information.\n3. Gates are common features in buildings. Gate toppling accidents could have been easily\nprevented if safety considerations had been made and implemented at the gate design,\ninstallation, operation and maintenance stages.\n(I) Design Phase\n4. All gates should be designed such that their installation, maintenance and operation can be\ncarried out safely. The following should be considered when designing the gate:\nA. Gate structures should be structurally stable and designed in accordance to prevailing\nstructural codes (eg. BS5950, EC3).\nB. Manually operated gates should be designed such that the force, to open or close it, is\nrestricted to 150N for residential property gates and 260N per person for commercial/\nindustrial property gates.\nC. Guides and stoppers should be adequately designed and sized to ensure that the gate\nwill not over-travel nor will it topple in the event of derailment during operation.\nD. Housings for motors of electrical gates should be standalone elements and not have\ndual usage as stoppers or guides for the gates. This is to ensure that the gates remain\nsafe for use in the event the motors and housings are removed for maintenance.\nE. The gates (including door leaves, handles and fittings) should be designed such that the\nrisk to the users having their hands crushed, cut or trapped is minimized. This could be\nDate of Issue Classification Circular No.\n1 Mar 2012 Residential & Industrial Gates OSHD/ OSHI/ MI 043 Page 1 of 8\nRef: 20120301-44\ndone through having suitable clearances or through provision of guarding. Examples of\nthese could be found in EN 12604:2000 Annex C.\n(II) Construction, Installation and Testing\n5. The following should be observed during any gate installation:\nA. Installation of gates should be carried out in accordance to the installation sequence as\nprovided by the gate manufacturer.\nB. In the event that the gate has to be left unsecured, it should be propped to prevent\ntoppling. Warning signs should be erected to warn workers and public not to approach\nthe gate.\nC. Risk assessment on the installation process should be conducted to identify all potential\nhazards that may arise during the installation of the gate. Risk control measures should\nthen be recommended and implemented.\nD. Testing of the gate to verify the provisions against derailment/ disengagement should be\ndone by the installer before handover to the building owner. The recommended testing\nprocedures (as detailed in EN 12605:2000 Industrial, commercial and garage doors and\ngates \u2013 Mechanical aspects \u2013 Test methods) are as follows:\na. The gate should be pushed against a cube of 400mm length placed in the travel\npath of the gate.\nb. The gate should be pushed twice to their terminal position with a force of 300N and\nspeed of 0.3 m/s.\nc. The failure of a non-rigid suspension element (chain, rope or strap) should be\nsimulated.\nd. The gate should then be examined to see if they remain on track or on the guiding\nelement and if there was any permanent deformation which would affect their\nfunction.\n(III) Operation, Repair & Maintenance\n6. The following measures should be taken by the owner or occupier when operating and\nmaintaining a gate:\nA. All operation and maintenance should be carried out in accordance to the manufacturer\u2019s\ninstruction. Where the gate is designed, fabricated and installed by a sub-contractor, the\nmaintenance should be carried out in accordance to the sub-contractor\u2019s instruction.\nB. Risk assessment on gate operation and on the maintenance process should be\nconducted to identify all potential hazards that may arise during operating or maintaining\nthe gate. Risk control measures should then be recommended and implemented.\nC. Any repair of the gate should be carried out by competent persons unless otherwise as\nrecommended by the manufacturer- or sub-contractor.\nDate of Issue Classification Circular No.\n1 Mar 2012 Residential & Industrial Gates OSHD/ OSHI/ MI 043 Page 2 of 8\nRef: 20120301-44\nD. Gates should be checked and maintained periodically according to the manufacturer\u2019s or\nsub-contractor\u2019s recommendation. In addition, the track for the gate should be properly\nupkept to prevent any accumulation of debris which could cause the derailment of the\ngates.\nE. All employees operating the gate should be briefed to inspect/check the gate and to\nensure proper maintenance.\n7. Please refer to the informative references in Appendix 2. While no submission on gate\ndesign/ installation/ construction is required, you are to ensure that the design takes safety of\ninstallers and operators into consideration.

The incident\ngate leaf was almost 9.7m wide and 2.5m high and weighed about 900kg. The gate was\ndesigned to be mechanically operated by remote but the motor which was meant to\noperate the gate leaf had been removed for maintenance prior to the accident. As a result,\nthe gate had to be manually pushed.\nDue to the removal of the motor housing which was also used as a rear stopper, the gate\nhad over travelled. The gate had rollers installed to guide the gate leaf along the rail while\noutriggers were mounted to prop the travelling gate but both fittings did not serve to\nprevent the gate from toppling during the accident.\nPhoto showing the plan view of the incident gate\nRoller\nGuide 9.7m Initial position of\nmotor housing\n2.5m\nInitial position of Incident\nmotor housing Gate Leaf\nPhotos showing the initial location of the rear stopper (Motor housing)\nDate of Issue Classification Circular No.\n1 Mar 2012 Residential & Industrial Gates OSHD/ OSHI/ MI 043 Page 4 of 8\nARePf: P20E12N03D01I-X44 1\nCase 2 \u2013 29 April 2011\nTwo technicians were injured when a wooden sliding gate under installation toppled on\nthem. The technicians were surveying the utilities distribution board of a private residential\nunit when the accident occurred. In order to access the distribution board, the technicians\nhad moved the gate and it toppled on them.\nIt was found that there were no informative or warning signs displayed near the gate to\ncaution persons that the gate was still being installed.

In a bid to release the gate, the injured pulled hard on the gate, causing the gate\nleaf to unhinge and subsequently topple on him.\nPhoto showing the wheels of the incident gate not resting on the track\nPhoto showing one the wheels of the incident stuck in soft ground\nDate of Issue Classification Circular No.\n1 Mar 2012 Residential & Industrial Gates OSHD/ OSHI/ MI 043 Page 6 of 8\nARePf: P20E12N03D01I-X44 1\nCase 4 \u2013 28 October 2011\nThe Injured, a security officer had manually opened a sliding boundary gate when the gate\nleaf suddenly derailed and toppled, pinning him to the ground. The incident gate leaf was\n8.6m wide and 1.9m high. The gate was operated manually and the gate leaf was mounted\non two wheels travelling on a rail constructed from a right angle bracket.\nInvestigations revealed that the cause of the derailment was due to poor maintenance and\na visibly crooked track. The track was littered with concrete debris and litter which\ncontributed to the derailment of the gate.\nThe gate was installed with guide rollers and stoppers to prevent the toppling and over\ntraveling. However, the track on which the gate leaf travelled was mounted 70 mm above\nthe ground while the guide rollers which guide the traveling gate only overlapped the gate\nleaf by 25 mm. Hence, it was inadequate to prevent the gate from toppling once it derailed.\nPhoto showing the inadequacy of the gate design which failed to prevent the gate toppling\nPhotos showing the gap between concrete kerb on the track littered with debris and litters\nDate of Issue Classification Circular No.\n1 Mar 2012 Residential & Industrial Gates OSHD/ OSHI/ MI 043 Page 7 of 8\nARePf: P20E12N03D01I-X44 2\nINFORMATIVE REFERENCES\nA.

The number of accidents involving heavy vehicles rose to 877 in 2015, up from 839 the previous\nyear. Fig.1 shows the statistics on fatal and injury accidents involving heavy vehicles. Although fewer\nof these accidents were fatal, the statistics are disturbing with a rising trend of accidents involving\nheavy vehicle.\nFig. 1\nSpeeding and Red-Running\nSpeeding and red-running offences remain as key areas of concern for the heavy vehicle segment. Fig.\n2 shows the top 3 violations committed by heavy vehicles. Violations such as speeding and red-running\ncarry high penalties as they have higher propensity to result in serious injury or fatal accidents. The\npenalties for speeding and red-running are as listed in Annex A.\nSimilar to all other road users, heavy vehicle drivers are advised to practise good RoadSense by\nadhering to traffic regulations, and remembering that we all want to get home safe to our loved ones.\nFig. 2\nRoad Safety Measures\nHeavy vehicle fleet owners and companies play a key part to ensure the safety of their drivers and\nother road users. Besides reminding and encouraging their drivers to drive with good RoadSense,\nemployers also have a duty to take reasonably practicable measures to ensure the safety and health\nof his employees at work. Hence, they should implement the following elements (non-exhaustive) to\nsafeguard their drivers and other road users during work where applicable: The penalties for offences\nunder the Workplace Safety and Health Act (WSH Act) are in Annex B.\nChecklist \uf050/\uf04f\nRisk Assessment (RA) / Safe Work Procedure (SWP)\nTo conduct RA to identify/ evaluate the hazards/ risks exposed to the drivers;\nincluding any potential adverse behaviour as a result of remuneration\npractices, e.g. pay-per-trip\nTo develop risk control measures (including SWP) to address/ mitigate the\nidentified hazards/ risks in the RA\nTraining and Competency\nTo ensure that the driver is trained and competent to drive the specific type\nof vehicle assigned\nTo send the driver for defensive driving course/ refresher course to enhance/\nrefresh his driving, if necessary\nTo encourage their drivers maintain good driving records (no demerit points)\nMaintenance Regime and Fleet Management\nTo implement a regime for the maintenance of all vehicles in accordance to\nthe manufacturers\u2019 recommendations, so as to ensure its road worthiness; e.g.\ndaily pre-operation checks, periodic servicing, mandatory inspection, etc\nTo implement a system to manage the fleet of vehicles; e.g. GPS tracking\nsystem, speed monitoring system, etc\nTo ensure that speed limiters on heavy vehicles are functioning\nFatigue Management\nTo manage the drivers\u2019 work hours to prevent drivers from fatigue; e.g. limit\nshift work, job rotation, provide adequate break times, limit hours of overtime,\netc. More information on regulations on hours of work, overtime and rest days\ncan be found on MOM website at http://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-\npractices/hours-of-work-overtime-and-rest-days\nLet\u2019s Come Together\nThe success of building a culture of safe road behaviour doesn\u2019t just sit with any single individual.

The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) is sending out this circular to remind all parties undertaking the\nmanufacture, supply, design, installation and supervision of proprietary table formwork structures of their\nobligations to ensure the safety of the structures.\n3. Design and Documentation\na) Discuss and evaluate all design risks including any risk involving work at height and formwork\ninstability. Pay attention to possible site constraints, obstructions or unsound supporting elements,\netc that can undermine the stability of the formwork structures. The evaluation should be done\njointly by the formwork designers and the Design for Safety (DfS) review team.\nb) Design all proprietary table formwork structures to support a minimum of 2.0 factor of safety for\nstrength and stability, for the most adverse of loads and load combinations.\nc) Detail all manufacturer\u2019s recommendations critical to the method and sequence of work including\nsafe erection, lifting, repositioning and dismantling in the design or drawings.\nd) Delineate all bracings and tie-backs essential to provide strength and stability against unbalanced\nforces in the formwork drawings, with clear annotation with regards to their make, size, position and\nanchorage (to a structural support) as appropriate.\ne) Consult the designer or Professional Engineer (\u201cPE\u201d) for approval if deviations to the design are\nrequired. Include clear instructions of such deviations as well as the approved method and sequence\nof work into the formwork drawings.\nf) Include all formwork elements in the design even if the elements are not part of the proprietary table\nformwork e.g., beam side formwork. Check that the PE certificate(s) for safe use cover the complete\ntable formwork setup including such non-proprietary elements.\n4. Training and Risk Communication\na) Document any residual risks in the DfS Register and communicate these risks and their control\nmeasures to contractors for action and awareness.\nb) Train erectors and supervisors on the procedures and any limitation of the table formwork as\nindicated in the manufacturer\u2019s training syllabus.\nc) Brief the erectors and supervisors on all project specific conditions and expected constraints during\nerection, lifting and repositioning.\n5. Method and Sequence of Work During Erection, Lifting and Repositioning\na) Use only equipment approved by the proprietary table formwork manufacturer for erection, lifting\nand repositioning in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended procedures.\nb) Incorporate manufacturer\u2019s recommendations pertaining to the mode of lifting, rigging point\nlocations and the type of lifting gears into the lifting plans. Ensure sufficient clearance is provided\nbetween the load and any potential encumbrances along its path.\nc) As a general guide, place lifting points at the top of the load. Avoid tilting of the lifted load by\ndesigning out any load eccentricity during lift. Where practicable, consider appropriate lifting tools\nsuch as lifting forks.\nd) Adhere to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations on Height-to-breadth ratio (h:b) of tower table\nformwork and travelling speed during repositioning.\ne) Adhere to safe work procedures for working-at-height during rigging or unrigging operations of the\ntable formwork.\n6.

They resulted in some\nproperty damage and could have led to the loss of lives.\nThe first incident occurred on 30 July. A tableform erected between the 5th and 6th\nstorey of a building under construction overturned and fell to the ground level while it\nwas being repositioned on-site.\nThe second happened on 3 August with a tableform erected at the top storey of a multi-\nstorey carpark being constructed. It overturned and fell to the ground level when it was\nlifted into position and released from the lifting gears.\nThe third incident occurred on 6 August where a tableform similarly overturned and fell\noff a building under construction. It was struck by another tableform that had been\ntangled with a third tableform being lifted. The tableform fell on an empty lorry.\nOccupiers, employers, principals and tableform manufacturers and suppliers should\nadopt the following risk control measures to prevent similar incidents:\nSafe tableform erection, lifting and repositioning\n\u2022 Use method(s) recommended by tableform manufacturers for safe erection, lifting and\nrepositioning of tableforms/formworks.\n\u2022 If other methods are needed due to site constraints, a new method statement must be\nco-developed with and endorsed by the manufacturer before proceeding with site-\nspecific Risk Assessment (RA) and development of a Safe Work Procedure (SWP). The\nRA and SWP must be communicated to workers before work.\nThis is because unapproved methods, especially tableforms with high height-to-breadth\naspect ratios, are prone to instability during repositioning, which can result in\noverturning.\nSafe tableform installation\n\u2022 Deploy only trained and competent workers for the tableform work.\n\u2022 Ensure that workers are familiar with the SWP before starting work. Otherwise, provide\nrefresher training for the workers.\n\u2022 Provide on-site supervision to workers to ensure compliance with the SWP.\n\u2022 Secure the tableform/formwork structure with tie-backs once it is in position and\nbefore the lifting gears are released to prevent overturning.\nSafe tableform lifting\n\u2022 Establish and implement a lifting plan to ensure lifting operations can be carried out\nsafely.\n\u2022 Such a plan, amongst other things, must indicate how the tableform/formwork\nstructure is to be rigged before the lift. Use only rigging points recommended by the\nmanufacturer. Consult the manufacturer if the recommended rigging points are not\nsuitable due to operational or site constraints.\nUnsafe lifting of tableform/formwork structures can potentially create a chain reaction.\nFor instance, a collapsing structure can strike other nearby materials or structures and\ncause them to cascade down.\nRefer to Part IX: Formwork Structures of the Workplace Safety and Health (Construction)\nRegulations 2007 and Singapore Standard SS 580: 2020 Code of Practice for Formwork\nfor legislative requirements and best practices for the safe erection, use, transfer,\nalteration and dismantling of formwork structures.\nDesign for Safety (DfS)\nDevelopers should ensure that DfS review meetings are attended by temporary works\ndesigners to address temporary works issues such as formwork design risks.\nTemporary works designers should eliminate design risks via design enhancements. If\nthe risks cannot be eliminated via design, they must provide precautionary measures\nand clear instructions/warnings to the affected stakeholders who will be performing the\nworks.\nWe regret that we are unable to reply to emails at this email address.

Such corrosion if left unchecked could\nlead to cracks, leakages and even catastrophic failures of autoclaves.\nThe photographs in the report show the extent of corrosion in some autoclaves that\nwere inspected recently despite the fact that they were made from stainless steel\nand that they had been in service for a relatively short period of only about 5 to 6\nyears.\nCauses of Corrosion\nIt is indeed not normal for an autoclave to exhibit such appalling conditions as\nshown, after only 5 years of service as most autoclave chambers are made of\nstainless steel that should not corrode. However, stainless steel is susceptible to\nchlorine attack that would cause it to corrode quickly. It is suspected that the main\ncause of the corrosion was the use of tap water (which is chlorinated).\nPreventive Measures\nUsers of autoclaves are strongly advised to use distilled water for the operation of\ntheir autoclaves to prevent similar deterioration that could lead to a catastrophic\nfailure of the autoclave.\nOccupational Safety and Health Division\nMinistry of Manpower\nPhotographs showing corrosion in autoclaves\n\n",

Heat stress, if not\nwell controlled, puts workers at risk of developing heat stroke, an acute life-threatening condition that\ncan be fatal if not promptly treated. In Dec 2010, an employer was fined $20,000 for failing to take\nadequate measures to prevent a workplace fatality from heat stroke.\nDuties under the Workplace Safety and Health Act and its Subsidiary Legislation\n2. The Workplace Safety and Health Act places the responsibility on the employers to take\nreasonably practicable measures to ensure the health and safety of their employees at work. Under\nthe Workplace Safety and Health (General Provisions) Regulations, the occupier of the workplace has\nto protect workers from excessive temperatures and harmful radiation.\n3 Employers are also required under the WSH (Risk Management) Regulations to conduct risk\nassessment to address the safety and health risks in the workplace, including eliminating or reducing\nthe risks of heat stress on workers. Where there are occurrences of heat stroke cases, the employers\nare to report such cases to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) via http://mom.gov.sg/iReport\nMeasurements of Environmental Heat Stress\n4. An environmental heat stress index is one of the indicators for risk of heat injuries and should\nbe used in conjunction with other factors to assess overall risk. These include the Wet Bulb Globe\nTemperature (WBGT) and the Heat Stress Index.\nIdentification of Heat Stress\n5. Supervisors must be trained to watch out for heat stress symptoms in workers and must do\ntheir part to remind workers of the need for hydration. Heat stroke must be suspected as one of the\ncauses if a worker collapses at the workplace, without signs of external injury. Workers should also be\nreminded to report to their supervisors if they feel unwell, tired, dizzy or have headaches and painful\ncramps. They should be referred to the doctor for further checks.\nRef: 20120815-49\nMeasures to reduce Heat Stress\n6. Companies should take necessary measures to reduce the risk of heat stress to their workers.\nSuch measures include:\na. Heat acclimatisation\nNewly assigned workers, especially those who have come from a cooler climate must be\nacclimatised to the hot weather in Singapore to allow the body to slowly adapt to the hot\nenvironment. They would need at least one to two weeks to adjust to local weather conditions\nand the workload. They should not start working at the full workload in the hot environment\nupon arrival. Workers should undergo a 14-day heat acclimatisation (HA) programme in the\nfirst 2 weeks of employment. The HA comprises daily exposure to heat stress (working under\nhot environment) for up to 14 days. The HA takes the form of gradual increase in work\nduration under the hot environment, increasing from 2 hours per day to the full work duration\nover 14 days.\nDuring the period of acclimatization, workers should be closely supervised and be given the\nflexibility to have more rest breaks and longer acclimatization period, if needed. Work targets\nshould not be excessive. They should be monitored closely for symptoms of heat stroke and\nmust report to their supervisors if they feel unwell during the period.\nAcclimatization is lost during periods when there is no exposure to heat stress. Workers\nreturning from a prolonged leave (more than one week) should be re-acclimatized. Workers\nreturning from a prolonged illness should consult a doctor before going back to work \u2013 they\nshould also be re-acclimatized.\nb. Adequate water intake and drinking facilities\nWorkers should start the work day by ensuring that they are well hydrated and not thirsty.\nThey should be encouraged to keep themselves hydrated all the time and supervised drinking\nor \u201cwater parades\u201d can help ensure this. Employers should provide cool drinking water at\nconvenient and accessible locations to facilitate hydration.\nc. Work schedule and provision of mechanical aids\nHeavy physical work or work under the sun should be scheduled to the cooler parts of the day\n(early morning or late afternoon) where possible. There needs to be adequate rest periods in\nbetween work periods. Under severe conditions, this duration of rest should be increased\naccordingly. Mechanical aids such as lifting equipment can be used to reduce physical\nworkload.\nd. Shaded areas for work and rest\nShaded areas should be provided for workers who spend significant time under the sun. Cool\ndrinking water should be provided in the rest areas.\ne. Clothing in outdoor environments\nWorkers should wear loose-fitting, light coloured clothing while working in the hot\nenvironment.\nf. Worker training and reporting\nAll workers must be educated on the dangers of heat-related disorders. They should be told\nto report immediately to their supervisors if they are feeling unwell and brought to see a\ndoctor. All workers should complete the Construction Safety Orientation Course (CSOC)\nbefore starting work. Workers should also work with their fellow workers and watch out for\nsymptoms of heat stroke for each other.\nRef: 20120815-49\ng. Fitness to work\nWorker should pass their pre-employment medical examinations and those who are ill should\nreport to their supervisor before starting work.\nEmergency First Aid\n7. Workers suspected of succumbing to the heat should receive immediate first aid treatment\nwhich includes moving the worker to a shady area, removing the clothing, applying cool water to the\nskin and fanning to promote evaporative skin cooling. Ice packs may be placed under the armpits and\ngroins to reduce the body temperature while awaiting the arrival of the ambulance. Heat stroke is a\nmedical emergency and such workers should be sent to the nearest hospital with appropriate medical\nfacilities.\nSummary\n8. Prevention is key to reducing heat-related disorders. By controlling the factors that contribute to\nheat stress, we can reduce the potential for harm. More details on managing heat stress are available\nin the WSH Council Guidelines on \"Managing Heat Stress at the Workplace\" available at:\nhttps://www.wshc.sg/wps/portal/resources?action=detailedInfoStop&fInfoStopID=IS2010092700631.\nFor clarifications, please contact Dr Yong Zhi Yong at Yong_Zhi_Yong@mom.gov.sg or at contact no:\n6692 5072.\nDr Kenneth Choy\nfor Commissioner for Workplace Safety and Health\nOccupational Safety and Health Division\nMinistry of Manpower\nDate of issue Classification Circular no\n15 Aug 2012 Heat Stress OSHD/SPECS/OM/HS/01-2012",

The\ndeceased and co\u2010workers were installing the tie\u2010backs of the tower crane to an adjacent building\nat the 14th storey when the accident occurred. Preliminary investigations revealed that the\ndeceased may have fallen from the tower crane tie\u2010back during the installation work. This circular\nserves as a reminder to duty\u2010holders of their statutory duties under the Workplace Safety and\nHealth Act (WSH Act), the WSH (Work at Heights) Regulations 2013, as well as the other WSH\nsubsidiary legislation, to ensure safe working at heights.\nMeasures to Address Fall Hazards\n2 Under the WSH (Work at Heights) Regulations 2013, all ACCs shall fulfill their duties as the\nresponsible person1 (employer or principal2) of anyone who carries out or is to carry out any work\nat heights. This will include performing erection, dismantling or alteration of a mobile or tower\ncrane while working at heights. As part of their duties, ACCs shall ensure the following:\na) The travel restraint or fall arrest system used in the workplace\ni. is of good construction, sound material and adequate strength;\nii. is free from patent defects; and\niii. is suitable and safe for the purpose for which it is intended;\n1 Under regulation 2 of the WSH (Work at Heights) Regulations 2013, A Responsible Person, in relation to a person who\ncarries out or is to carry out any work at height, means (a) his employer; or (b) the principal under whose direction he\ncarries out or is to carry out any such work.\n2 A Principal is any person or organization who engages another person or organization to supply labour or perform\nwork under a contract for service.\n20130726-60\nb) Every person using the travel restraint or fall arrest system is trained in the safe and\ncorrect use of the system.\nc) Where a fall arrest system is used in the workplace,\ni. the system shall incorporate a shock absorbing device, limiting forces to the\nuser\u2019s body; and\nii. In event of a fall, enough fall clearance is available to prevent the user from\nhitting the ground, objects or surfaces.\n3 In addition to the above, ACCs shall also ensure that they comply with all the other safety\nrequirements for working safely at heights as prescribed in the WSH (Work at Heights) Regulations\n2013.\nSafe Work Procedures and Permit to Work System for Work at Heights\n4 Safe work procedures and permit\u2010to\u2010work system should be implemented to ensure work at\nheights is planned and carried out safely and systematically. Under the WSH (Work at Heights)\nRegulations 2013, the permit\u2010to\u2010work system will be required to be implemented for all hazardous\nwork at heights3 with effect from 1 May 2014. Competent persons will be required to be\nappointed for the roles of the work\u2010at\u2010height Safety Assessor and Authorised Manager\nrespectively under the permit\u2010to\u2010work system. This is to ensure that such work will only be\nallowed to be carried out after all necessary control measures have been implemented.\n5 For further practical guidance, Occupiers and Responsible Persons are advised to refer to the\nApproved Code of Practice for Working Safely at Heights, as well as the various relevant Guidelines\non Work at Heights issued by the WSH Council (e.g. Guidelines on Personal Protective Equipment\nfor Work at Heights).

        "content": "Ref: 2009-35\nTo all lift contractors\nSafety Circular: Lifts Installation Works\nA fatal accident occurred recently in May 2009 involving lift upgrading. A\nworker died after the lift\u2019s counterweight frame dropped and crushed onto him during\nthe installation of the counterweights.\n2. As a follow up to this recent incident, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM)\ntogether with the Housing & Development Board (HDB) would like to highlight the\nfollowing to all contractors undertaking lift installation work.\n3. Many of the lift installation works are undertaken by sub-contractors. It is\ncritical that these sub-contractors and their workers possess the necessary competency\nand capability in order to carry out the installation work safely. Main contractors have\na duty to supervise these sub-contractors to ensure that the method statements are\nadhered to, particularly the proper installation of load bearing parts e.g. the termination\nwire ropes, as failure to do so can have serious consequences to the integrity of the lifts.\nMain contractors should conduct regular communication and audit on the sub-\ncontractors to ensure that this is adhered to.\n4. Contractors undertaking installation work should also conduct a risk assessment\nprior to starting work and identify the hazards in the installation work taking into\nconsideration the configuration of the lift shaft. A safe work procedure should then be\nestablished. A key concern is the provision of safe access and egress for workers to\nreach areas within the lift shaft to carry out the installation work. In situations where\nworkers are required to work at locations in which a proper work platform is not\nfeasible, adequate fall protection measures must be provided such as safety harness and\nsecured anchorage points\n5. Lastly, contractors are also reminded that you have a duty to ensure that your\nworkers have adequate instruction, information, training and supervision as is necessary\nfor them to perform their work. . Under the Workplace Safety and Health Act and its\nsubsidiary regulations, contractors are required to ensure that all reasonably practicable\nmeasures, such as those listed above, are taken to ensure the safety of their workers.\nThose who fail to do so may be taken to task under the Act.\nThe above statement is jointly issued by Housing & Development Board (HDB) and\nMinistry of Manpower (MOM).",

        "depth": 1,
        "content": "Ref: 20100729-38\nAll Owners of Lorry Cranes\nAuthorised Examiners (Lifting Equipment)\nOther Interested Parties\nDear Sir,\nREMINDER: SAFE WORK PROCEDURES FOR OPERATING LORRY CRANES ON PUBLIC ROADS\nOn 16 July 2010, a lorry crane used for tree pruning exercise along a road was involved in a serious accident\nwhen the retracting boom hit a public bus. One passenger died and several others injured. It is important to note that\nstrict adherence to safe work procedures for lorry crane operations are critical to ensure safety of workers as well as\nother road users. The purpose of this circular is to remind employers on the common workplace hazards involved in\nsuch works and their preventive measures.\nCompetency of Operator of Lorry Crane\n2. It is the employer\u2019s duty to ensure that only trained and competent personnel are allowed to operate\nthe lorry cranes. The operator must conduct an operational check on the crane and its lifting gears daily before use.\nThe operator shall also ensure that the lorry crane is properly maintained and inspected at regular intervals to ensure\nthat it continues to be in safe working condition. The employer is also required to ensure that the operator is familiar\nwith the risks associated with the operation of the lorry crane and the measures taken to reduce the risks. Appended\nbelow are some examples of the risks encountered and the measures that must be implemented.\nA) Risk due to Traffic Movement\n3. Ongoing traffic movement around the work area can pose a danger to the workers working along the\nroadsides. Other vehicles may knock onto the workers, or may collide with the lorry crane parked along the roads. To\nensure the safety of workers and other road users, proper traffic management is therefore critical. While working\nalong the roadsides, contractors must follow the Land Transport Authority (LTA) - Code of Practice for Traffic\nControl at Work Zone. Control measures stipulated in the LTA\u2019s Code of Practice include cordoning of work area,\nre-directing of traffic flow, installation of truck mounted attenuator (TMA), placement of warning lights and signage. In\naddition, workers deployed to work along the roadsides are required, among other things, to wear luminous vests to\nenhance their visibility to other road users.\nB) Risk involved in the Operation of Lorry Cranes\n4. Lorry Cranes are generally used for loading and unloading as well as for lifting of heavy objects or debris at\nthe work area. In the course of the crane operation, besides the moving traffic hazard, the workers also face other\nhazards such as being crushed by collapsed crane and being hit by falling or swinging loads. Cranes and their lifting\ngears shall be inspected by an Authorised Examiner once every 12 months to ensure that they can be operated\nsafely. Valid inspection certificates for the cranes and lifting gears must be made available prior to work\ncommencement.\n5. In the safe operation of the lorry cranes, particular attention shall be given to ensure that the lorry crane is\nparked on a firm and stable ground. The outriggers of the lorry crane shall also be fully extended to ensure the\nstability of the crane. The lifting zone shall also be clearly demarcated with warning signs so that no one (except the\nRef: 20100729-38\nauthorised personnel) shall be allowed to enter the barricaded area or to work within close proximity of the lorry\ncrane. The boom of crane shall also be retracted fully to its home position before the lorry crane can be driven away.\nC) Risk due to Working at Heights\n6. In carrying out certain works such as tree pruning, workers are often required to work at heights (such as\nworking from a man-cage attached to the lorry crane) to cut or trim the branches. As such, they are susceptible to\nfalling from heights. For safe conduct of work, measures such as the use of safety harness with fall arrestor must be\nprovided to the workers. Also, tree branches when cut, may land on the workers below. Hence, proper work\nprocedures and co-ordination among the workers stationed on top of the man-cage and those deployed on the\nground are essential.\nD) Risk due to Contact with Overhead Cables/Structures\n7. In the operation of lorry cranes, part of the crane may come into contact with overhead cables or other\nstructures (e.g. building fa\u00e7ade, street lights). Workers carrying out work activities using these cranes can be exposed\nto these hazards (e.g. electrical hazards involving overhead cables). Hence, adequate clearance between the lorry\ncrane and the overhead cables/structures must be maintained at all times.\nRisk Assessment\n8. Under the Workplace Safety and Health (Risk Management) Regulations, Risk Assessments shall be\nconducted to address the safety and health risks posed to any person who may be affected by the activities in the\nworkplace. In particular, employers have a duty to provide an effective management and control system for the use\nand operation of lorry cranes, including the need to develop and implement a safe work procedure (SWP) for the\nworks. More information on Risk Assessment can be found at the Workplace Safety and Health Council (WSHC)\nwebsite at https://www.wshc.sg/\n9. Further information on safety measures pertaining to operation of lorry cranes for landscaping works are given\nin the WSH Guidelines for Landscape and Horticulture Work. This Guideline was developed jointly by the\nWorkplace Safety and Health Council (WSHC) and the Centre for Urban Greenery and Ecology (CUGE), in\ncollaboration with MOM. The guideline can be downloaded at the WSHC\u2019s website at https://www.wshc.sg/. All\nowners of lorry cranes are to disseminate the information herein to their respective users or hirers of cranes and their\ncontractors.\n10. The above procedures are for your immediate compliance.\nOccupational Safety and Health Division\nYours faithfully 18 Havelock Rd,\nSingapore 059764\nTel : (65) 64385122\nFacsimile : (65) 63171261\nWebsite : http://www.mom.gov.sg/oshd/\nMR.

The department had recently received complaints on tower cranes being\nerected in factories and worksites in Singapore. The nature of the complaints\nare as follows:\na. The actual tower crane that was installed in the factory was not the tower\ncrane that was descibed in the certificate issued by the Approved Person.\nb. The actual tower crane that was installed had exceeded the 15 years limit on\nthe usage of tower crane.\n2. The Department had found that some of the cases referred to in the above\ncomplaints are true.\n3. We had also discovered the used of pirated - non original parts being used on\nsuch crane being installed.\n4. You may have issued certificates for tower cranes, which in some cases do not\nmeet the department's requirements. You are, if you are carrying out\ninspections of tower cranes, to be extra vigilant and very thorough in your\ninspections. If you have doubts about the integrity of the crane or the\ninformation provided by the crane supplier, you are advised not to issue the\ncertificate.\n5. In addition, it has also come to the attention of the Department that some tower\ncranes were erected without any safe means of access to the cabin for the\ncrane operator and for you as an inspector. This is a violation of the Factories\nAct Section 33. You are required to ensure that safe access is provided before\nyou issue the certificate for the tower crane.\nSNG WEE KIAT, SILAS\nfor CHIEF INSPECTOR OF FACTORIES",

With effect from 17 August 2020, all in-person WSH training for Worker/Operator and Supervisor-Level\ncourses listed in Annex A are allowed to resume.\n2. As a significant proportion of WSH trainees are foreign workers, it is critical that WSH training providers\nimplement Safe Management Measures (SMM) in Annex B in order to prevent the transmission of Covid-19.\nOtherwise if a cluster develops, not only will the operation of the training provider be suspended, it will also\nadversely affect other employers and workplaces. The key measures include:\na) All foreign workers attending any in-person training must possess the Green AccessCode available via\nSGWorkPass mobile app (link). This is to ensure the trainees are not subjected to any movement\nrestriction or staying in uncleared premises.\nb) Cohorting by classes:\nCohort Requirements\nForeign workers from the\na) Trainees for same class must come from not more than 3 employers.\nConstruction, Marine and\nThe trainees can be from different worksites.\nProcess (CMP) industry\nForeign workers from other b) Trainees for same class can be from different employers and different\nindustry (non-CMP) worksites.\nc) Local trainees are allowed to join either classes above but must meet\nLocals their respective conditions (i.e. for CMP, the locals together with the\nforeign workers must come from not more than 3 employers).\nc) No cross-mixing between classes and staggered break timings for different classes.\n3. MOM acknowledges that the above measures might affect the number of trainees or classes that\ntraining providers can run. However they are necessary to contain the spread of the Covid-19 virus at this stage.\nWe will review the above requirements when the situation improves further.\n4. We encourage WSH Training Providers to continue to adopt e-learning to the maximum extent\nespecially for Supervisor, Manager and WSH Professional courses. Training Providers may submit their e-learning\nproposals to the WSHC (wsh_training@wshc.sg) for evaluation.\nMinistry of Manpower Occupational Safety and Health Division\nMOM Services Centre, 1500 Bendemeer Road, Singapore 339946 Web www.mom.gov.sg Contact us www.mom.gov.sg/contact Tel 65 6438 5122 Page 1 of 5\nCircular: Resumption of in-person WSH Training\nMandatory WSH Training for Work Pass Holders\n5. We had earlier suspended the requirement for mandatory WSH training for work pass holders and\nallowed those affected to renew their work passes without attending the training. With the resumption of WSH\ntraining, we will reinstate the requirement:\na) From 1 January 2021, we will approve new issuance and renewal of work permits if the worker had\nattended the mandatory WSH training.\nb) There were around 3,000 new foreign workers who had entered Singapore before the circuit breaker\nin April and had not undergone the mandatory training. These workers will have to complete the\ntraining before 1 January 2021. Affected employers will be notified to send their workers for the\ntraining.\nc) For the rest of the workers who renewed their work permits without the mandatory training, they\nwill only need to attend the training before their next renewal. For example, if the worker\u2019s permit was\nrenewed in June 2020 for 1 year period, he will be required to attend the mandatory training before\nJune 2021.\nd) Employers are required to provide dedicated private transport for the foreign workers directly to the\ntraining venue and back to their accommodations.\n6. Notwithstanding the above, we encourage all employers and contractors to send your workers to attend\nthe mandatory training way in advance before the work permit expires. This will help training providers meet\ntheir minimal class size for the training course to be sustainable. As many of the workers have not worked for\nthe several months, the training will also be beneficial to help them regain their WSH awareness while at work.\nReminders to be vigilance\n7. Since the end of circuit breaker in June, 3 workers have sadly lost their lives arising from workplace\naccidents. We would thus like to remind all employers and contractors as you take precautions against\ntransmission of Covid-19, it is also equally important to ensure that WSH is not compromised as you resume\noperations.\nMinistry of Manpower Occupational Safety and Health Division\nMOM Services Centre, 1500 Bendemeer Road, Singapore 339946 Web www.mom.gov.sg Contact us www.mom.gov.sg/contact Tel 65 6438 5122 Page 2 of 5\nCircular: Resumption of in-person WSH Training\nAnnex A\nList of WSH Worker/Operator and Supervisor-Level Courses to Resume In-Person Training\nS/No. Course Name\n1 WSQ Apply Workplace Safety and Health in Construction Sites\n2 WSQ Apply Workplace Safety and Health in Metal Work\n3 WSQ Apply Workplace Safety and Health in Process Plant\n4 Shipyard Safety Instruction Course for Workers (General Trade) /\nWSQ Apply Workplace Safety and Health in Shipyard (General Trade)\n5 Logistics and Transport Safety Orientation Course /\nWSQ Apply Workplace Safety and Health in Logistics and Transportation\n6 Shipyard Safety Instruction Course for Workers (Hot Work Trade)\n7 Shipyard Safety Instruction Course for Workers (Painter Trade)\n8 Suspended Scaffolding Riggers\u2019 Course /\nWSQ Perform Rigging of Suspended Scaffold\n9 Work-at-Height Course for Workers /\nWSQ Perform Work-at-Height\n10 Metal Scaffold Erection Course /\nWSQ Perform Metal Scaffold Erection\n11 Compressed Air Works (Man-Lock) Attendant Course /\nWSQ Perform Man-lock Attendant Duties for Compressed Air Work\n12 Compressed Air Works (Medical-Lock Attendant) Course /\nWSQ Perform Medical-Lock Attendant Duties for Compressed Air Work\n13 WSQ Perform Work in Confined Space Operation\n14 Formwork Safety Course for Workers /\nWSQ Perform Formwork Activities\n15 Marine Metal Scaffolding Course for Scaffolders /\nWSQ Erect Metal Scaffold in Marine Industry\n16 Explosive Powered Tools Operator Course/\nWSQ Operate Explosive Powered Tools\n17 WSQ Perform Rigger and Signalman tasks\n18 Safety Orientation Course (Tunnelling) for Workers\n19 Commercial Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus Divers Course\n20 Surface Supplied Diving Equipment Divers Course\n21 WSQ Operate Forklift\n22 WSQ Operate Lorry Crane\n23 WSQ Operate Vertical Personnel Platform\n24 WSQ Operate Boom Lift\n25 WSQ Operate Scissor Lift\nMinistry of Manpower Occupational Safety and Health Division\nMOM Services Centre, 1500 Bendemeer Road, Singapore 339946 Web www.mom.gov.sg Contact us www.mom.gov.sg/contact Tel 65 6438 5122 Page 3 of 5\nCircular: Resumption of in-person WSH Training\nS/No. Course Name\n26 Workshop to Enhance Safety of Crane Operators (WESCO)\n27 Supervision of Metal Scaffold Erection Course /\nWSQ Supervise Metal Scaffold Erection\n28 Suspended Scaffolding Supervisor\u2019s Course /\nWSQ Supervise Suspended Scaffold\n29 Marine Metal Scaffolding Course for Supervisors /\nWSQ Supervise Metal Scaffold in Marine Industry\n30 Formwork Safety Course for Supervisors /\nWSQ Supervise Workplace Safety and Health for Formwork Construction\n31 Shipyard Supervisors Safety Course /\nWSQ Supervise Marine Work for Workplace Safety and Health\n32 Basic Industrial Safety and Health Course for Supervisors /\nWSQ Supervise Manufacturing Work for Workplace Safety and Health\n33 WSQ Supervise Workplace Safety and Health in Process Plant\n34 WSQ Supervise Work in Confined Space Operation\n35 WSQ Supervise Construction Work for Workplace Safety and Health\n36 WSQ Supervise Safe Lifting Operations\n37 WSQ Supervise Tunnelling Work for Workplace Safety and Health\n38 Commercial Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus Diving Supervisors Course\n39 Surface Supplied Diving Equipment Diving Supervisors Course\n40 Managing Work-At-Heights /\nWSQ Manage Work-At-Height\nMinistry of Manpower Occupational Safety and Health Division\nMOM Services Centre, 1500 Bendemeer Road, Singapore 339946 Web www.mom.gov.sg Contact us www.mom.gov.sg/contact Tel 65 6438 5122 Page 4 of 5\nCircular: Resumption of in-person WSH Training\nAnnex B\nSafe Management Measures (SMM) for WSH Training Providers to resume In-Person Training\n1.

Under Guideline B4(4) - Medical Certificates1 of the 2016 ECEG, it provides guidance to\nmedical practitioners when certifying if a patient is fit to return to work.\n2. The key concern when an injured worker is made to return to work is the risk of aggravating the injuries\nand reducing his chance of full recovery. In this respect, we would like to remind all medical practitioners to\nabide by the SMC\u2019s ECEG especially when issuing MC or light duties to injured workers.\n3. The number of days of MC should commensurate with the severity of the injury sustained by the\nworkers. In addition, light duties should be issued in the best interest of the worker, and only after taking into\nconsideration the following: -\na. The appropriate duties are indeed available at the injured\u2019s workplace. This entails an\nunderstanding of the injured\u2019s work environment, job duties and demands; and\nb. Whether the injured\u2019s incapacitated condition allow him to perform those duties without\naggravating his injuries.\n4. MOM has received feedback that some errant employers influence medical practitioners to downplay\nthe severity of the injuries by issuing lesser number of days of MC or issuing light duties in lieu of MC against the\ninterest of the injured worker. The employers do so to avoid reporting the accident to MOM or for the purpose\nof reducing compensation to the injured.\n5. We would like to urge all medical practitioners to exercise their professional judgement based on SMC\u2019s\nECEG and not be unduly influence by any other parties. If any parties attempt to exert undue influence, you\nmay report them to MOM. Any information shared will be kept confidential. For any clarification, please email\nMOM at mom_oshd@mom.gov.sg, or MOH at moh_info@moh.gov.sg.\nA/PROF. BENJAMIN ONG ER. HO SIONG HIN\nDIRECTOR OF MEDICAL SERVICES COMMISSIONER FOR\nMINISTRY OF HEALTH WORKPLACE SAFETY AND HEALTH\nMINISTRY OF MANPOWER\n1 If you are certifying that the patients are fit to return to work but with limitations on their level of activity at\nwork, you must first ensure that the patients\u2019 work conditions allow this and, to the best of your ability, ensure\nthat appropriate light duties are in fact available to the patients at their place of work.",

These products are regulated as cosmetic products under the Health Products\nAct and must meet safety requirements specified in Act, as well as the Health Products\n(Cosmetic Products \u2013 ASEAN Cosmetic Directive) Regulations. To assist nail salons with\ncompliance, the safety requirements are set out in this Circular.\nUse products that comply with safety requirements\na. Check that nail care products have been notified with the Health Sciences Authority (HSA),\nby checking HSA\u2019s infosearch. Ensure that nail care products used do not contain\nprohibited chemicals and that restricted chemicals are used within the specified conditions\nof use by referring to the Third Schedule of the cosmetic products regulation.\no For example:\n\u25aa Formaldehyde is not allowed to be added as an ingredient into all cosmetic\nproducts, including nail care products.\n\u25aa Toluene is only permitted in nail care products up to a maximum\nconcentration of 25%.\no A cosmetic product containing prohibited chemicals or using restricted chemicals\nnot within the specified conditions of use would be considered an unwholesome\nhealth product. A person who manufactures, imports, or supplies an unwholesome\nhealth product is liable to a fine of up to $50,000 and/or imprisonment up to 2 years.\no If the product cannot be found on HSA\u2019s infosearch, inform your nail care product\nsupplier to submit a notification via HSA\u2019s website. A person who supplies an un-\nnotified cosmetic product is liable to a fine of up to $20,000 and/or imprisonment\nup to 12 months.\n1 Exposure to chemicals in nail care products may occur via three routes: (1) inhaling volatile organic compounds\n(VOCs such as formaldehyde, toluene, xylene) emitted from the products; (2) getting the products on skin or in\neyes; or (3) ingesting the products that have come in contact with food or drinks. For example, exposure to\nformaldehyde can be through inhalation and this may lead to respiratory irritations, allergic reactions, and even\nlong-term serious health effects such as cancer.\nCircular: Protecting Employees\u2019 and Customers\u2019 Health from Chemicals in Nail Salons\nb. Ensure that nail care products used comply with labelling requirements, including listing\nall ingredients on the product labels.\no Inform your nail care product supplier to add a warning label of \u201cContains\nformaldehyde\u201d, if their products contain permitted preservatives that can release\nformaldehyde2 exceeding 0.05%.\no A person who supplies a cosmetic product that does not comply with this labelling\nrequirement is liable to a fine of up to $50,000 and/or imprisonment up to 2 years.\nChoose safer products\nc. Minimise chemical exposures by using products that are water-based or have a low\ncontent of volatile organic compounds (VOCs, such as formaldehyde, toluene, xylene).\nFollow safe work practices\nd. Communicate to employees the hazards of handling nail care products, and encourage\nthem to adopt safe work practices such as:\no Good housekeeping, e.g. keep dispenser bottles closed when not in use, clean up\nspills immediately.\no When applying nail care products, use only the amount needed to minimise\nchemical emissions into the air.\no Dispose of waste containing nail care products in sealed bags or keep wastebins\ncovered. Empty wastebins frequently.\no Where needed, use personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves and\ngoggles to protect employees\u2019 skin and eyes. Nail salon operators should refer to\nthe information in product labels or information sheets and provide the appropriate\nPPEs where necessary.\nEnsure good ventilation and indoor air quality\ne. Ventilate the space within the nail salon.\no If the salon has an air-conditioning and mechanical ventilation system that provides\noutdoor air, check that the system is in good working condition.\no In air-conditioned spaces with no outdoor air supply, consider opening doors and\nwindows to facilitate air exchange when feasible. Additionally, consider using local\nexhaust systems such as portable ventilation machines or ventilated tables to\nminimise exposure to VOCs emitted.\nf. To maintain good indoor air quality for the wellbeing of customers and employees,\noperators may also refer to the advisory limits of specific VOCs in the Singapore Standard\nSS554: Code Of Practice For Indoor Air Quality For Air-Conditioned Buildings.\n2\n2 E.g.

        "content": "Circular: MOM Safety Time Out Requirement\nMOM/OSHD/2022-03\n1 SEP 2022\nMOM Safety Time Out Requirement\nThere have been 36 fatal workplace accidents in 2022 so far, close to the 37 recorded for the whole\nof 2021. This is tragic and alarming. Almost all the fatal cases could have been prevented if workers were\nmore aware of risky situations, and companies ensured that workers followed safe working procedures.\n2. Close to half of the fatal accidents in the past three months were vehicular-related. Workers were\nkilled due to reasons like being in vehicles\u2019 blind spots, crushed between the moving parts of vehicles, run\nover by vehicles whose handbrakes were not engaged, or whose engines were left running when there was\nno driver/operator.\n3. To stop this worrying trend, MOM is requiring the following companies to conduct a mandatory\nSafety Time Out (STO) anytime during the 1 to 15 Sep 2022 period:\n- All companies in the construction, manufacturing, marine, process or transport and storage\nindustries; and\n- All companies in other industries, which use heavy or industrial vehicles (e.g. buses, lorries, prime\nmovers, forklifts, cranes, wheel-loader).\n4. Conducting the STO means suspending operations temporarily to review safety procedures and\ncomplete the STO activities in the STO Checklist (link in para 6 below). The length of the STO should be\nsufficiently long to review risks corresponding to the scale of the operations. Companies should conduct the\nSTO between 1 Sep 2022 and 15 Sep 2022 . For companies that need to operate 24/7, you can choose to do\nthe STO for different teams of workers separately, such that critical work can still proceed at all times, rather\nthan for all workers to pause work. This STO should cover all workplace risks but pay special attention to\nreinforcing vehicular safety due to the frequency of such incidents.\n5. STO activities can take various forms, including (but not limited to) the following:\nFor top management1:\n\u2022 Personally do a walk-about on site to encourage workers to report safety risks and near misses\nto their supervisors. Ask workers to surface their safety concerns, if any, and reassure them that\nthey will not be penalised for doing so. Emphasise top management\u2019s commitment to safety and\ninform site/project managers and supervisors that any safety risks should be resolved before\nwork commencement.\n\u2022 Share learning points from recent fatal accidents from the WSH Alerts with all workers, to avoid\na repeat of such cases in your own company.\n1 \u201cTop management\u201d refers to the chief executive, managing director, or other similar officer in the company\npurporting to act in any such capacity.\nMinistry of Manpower Occupational Safety and Health Division\nMOM Services Centre, 1500 Bendemeer Road, Singapore 339946 Web www.mom.gov.sg Contact us www.mom.gov.sg/contact Tel 65 6438 5122 Page 1 of 2\nCircular: MOM Safety Time Out Requirement\nFor WSH personnel:\n\u2022 Identify any new risks that were not factored into the Risk Assessment, and devise control measures\nto mitigate these risks. Pay special attention to mitigate the risks of recent vehicular-related fatal\naccidents.\n\u2022 Ensure that the control measures in the company\u2019s Risk Assessment are being implemented.\n\u2022 Hold workshops or meetings with workers to recap basic site safety, and how they can uphold good\nWSH standards.\n6. To guide your company in implementing the STO, you can refer to the WSH Council\u2019s resources,\nincluding a Safety Time Out checklist, WSH Alerts on recent fatal cases, and other relevant information, which\ncan be found on the WSH Council\u2019s website here.\n7. As this is a period of heightened safety, MOM requires your company to complete the activities in\nthe Safety Time Out checklist anytime during the 1 to 15 Sep 2022 timeframe. You are encouraged to take\nmore measures as well, beyond what was stated. We advise you to retain evidence of your STO activities. If\nMOM finds that the STO activities were not done by 15 Sep 2022, your company will face debarment from\nhiring new work pass holders for 1 month.\n8. Prevent more accidents by setting aside the time and management attention to conduct an effective\nSTO.\nMinistry of Manpower Occupational Safety and Health Division\nMOM Services Centre, 1500 Bendemeer Road, Singapore 339946 Web www.mom.gov.sg Contact us www.mom.gov.sg/contact Tel 65 6438 5122 Page 2 of 2",

Such \u201cfloor cranes\u201d are deemed to be lifting machines and they shall not be used unless the\ncranes have been tested and examined by Authorised Examiners (AE), and issued with signed\ncertificates of test and examination. \u201cFloor cranes\u201d should be classified under the classification code\nof 699\u2010Other Mobile Cranes n.e.c.\nFigure 1 Figure 2\nTesting and Examination of \u201cfloor cranes\u201d\n2 These cranes should be tested and examined as a whole system (and not just individual\ncomponent such as the winch). During such examination, AEs have to review and satisfied that such\ncranes are properly and adequately designed and is safe for its intended use. As these cranes are\ntypically deployed to lift loads from the exterior of the building, the design shall take into account,\namong others, the effect of wind loading on its stability so that the cranes would not fall off from the\nedge of the building.\nOccupational Safety and Health Division\n1500 Bendemeer Road #03-02\nMinistry of Manpower Services Centre\nSingapore 339946\nTel : (65) 64385122\nFacsimile : (65) 63171261\nWebsite : http://www.mom.gov.sg/oshd/\nEmail : mom_oshd@mom.gov.sg\nPage 1 of 2\n3 AEs are also required to conduct tests and examination to ensure that the cranes are without\ndefects and functioning properly. This should also include verification that the crane is manufactured\nin accordance to design. The conditions of safe use, such as the maximum safe working load and the\nnumber of counterweights required, are to be clearly stated in the certificate of test and\nexamination.\n4 AEs should not certify that the crane is safe to use if you have doubt on its safe design and\nusage.\nReminders to AEs on carrying out testing and examination\n5 We would also take this opportunity to remind AEs that during the conduct of testing and\nexamination of any statutory equipment, AEs must exercise due diligence and not accept an\ninadequate or unsafe design of the equipment only on the basis that it has been previously issued\nwith a certificate of test and examination. AEs should also carry out such test and examination\npersonally and the appointment of a proxy / another person to conduct inspection on behalf is not\nallowed. Last but not least, AEs are also reminded that all certificates of test and examination (for\nlifting machines, lifting appliances and lifting platforms) have to be issued via Ministry of Manpower\u2019s\niOSH system.\n6 For further clarification on the matter above, you can contact us at mom_oshd@mom.gov.sg\n(please attention to Er.

The SHMS of certain\nclasses of workplaces2 must be audited by WSH Auditors at prescribed intervals.\nWSH Auditors must exercise due diligence in determining the effectiveness of the\nSHMS and the level of compliance to the various regulatory requirements by the\naudited organisation.\nDuties of WSH Auditors\n2 The Occupational Safety and Health Division (OSHD) conducted an exercise\nrecently to check on the audits conducted by the WSH Auditors, including their\nfindings and recommendations. This exercise covered more than 100 workplaces\nacross various industries. WSH Auditors are to take note of the following guidance in\nresponse to the issues observed during the exercise:\na) The findings in the audit reports should reflect actual implementation of\nSHMS at the workplace. We have noted numerous situations where the audit\nreport indicated that the Occupiers had in place certain OSH programmes but\nonsite verification showed otherwise. For example, an audit report indicated\nthat the Occupier had a respiratory protection programme but in actual fact,\nno such programme was implemented at the workplace.\nb) WSH Auditors should impress upon the Occupier that the SHMS implemented\nshould conform to the relevant standards. Auditors must validate such\nconformance during the audit. For example, we have observed that some\nAuditors had failed to validate the existence of safe work procedures for core\nactivities which are required to be established in a typical construction\nworksite under the Singapore Standard CP 79.\nc) WSH Auditors should check on the closure of findings arising from the\npreviously conducted SHMS audits and update their status in the current\naudit report.\n1 Please refer to the Second Schedule of the WSH (SHMS & Auditing) Regulations for workplaces\nrequired to implement SHMS.\n2 For workplaces required to appoint WSH Auditors, please refer to Third Schedule of the WSH (SHMS\n& Auditing) Regulations.\nRef: 20110621-41\n3 Arising from this exercise, seven WSH Auditors were called up to clarify and\nexplain their audit findings. Three of the WSH Auditors were subsequently issued\nwith Notices of Non-Compliance (NNCs) for having major lapses in their SHMS audit\nreports. Another three WSH Auditors were served with advisory letters for certain\nshortcomings when performing SHMS audits. OSHD will continue to conduct such\nexercises on WSH Auditors and the organization they audits.\nExisting Restricted Category WSH Auditors\n4 During the MOM WSH Auditors Forum that was conducted on 16 Feb 2011,\nwe had announced that a single category WSH Auditor scheme will be introduced to\nreplace the current two-tier scheme (Open and Restricted Categories). This new\nscheme will take into effect on 1 Aug 2011. All Open Category WSH Auditors will\nautomatically be emplaced into the new scheme. For the Restricted Category WSH\nAuditors, their status as WSH Auditors will be suspended until they have attained the\nGraduate Certificate in WSH (Level D) certification.\nConSASS Audits for Construction Worksites\n5 With effect from 1 Aug 2011, all construction worksites with contract sum of\nS$30 million or more are required to have their mandatory SHMS audits conducted\nbased on the ConSASS audit checklist. Upon completion of the ConSASS Audit, the\naudit scores and the supporting audit documents will be required to be submitted\nthrough the WSH eServices located in the MOM website. We will be contacting the\nregistered WSH Auditing Organisations to attend a briefing regarding the online\nsubmission.\n6 WSH Auditing Organisations are reminded to submit their quarterly summary\nof SHMS audits conducted and the quarterly projection of SHMS audits to the\nOccupational Safety and Health Division at mom_oshd@mom.gov.sg.\n7 For clarifications, please contact Jaime Lim at Jaime_Lim@mom.gov.sg.\nKEVIN TEOH\nDeputy Commissioner for Workplace Safety and Health\nOccupational Safety and Health Division\nMinistry of Manpower",

Under Phase Two of the re-opening of businesses, Skills Future Singapore SSG has allowed in-house\ntraining to resume subject to the implementation of Safe Management Measures (SMM)1. Training providers\n(TP) should also continue to adopt e-learning to the maximum extent possible.\n2. There are WSH courses that involved training of foreign workers many of whom are still subjected to\nmovement restrictions (either staying in uncleared dormitories or subjected to Quarantine Orders) and hence\nunable to come out of the dormitories to physically attend the training courses. We need to be more cautious in\nallowing physical in-person training especially for different cohorts of foreign workers so as to minimise the risk of\nCovid-19 transmission.\n3. In view of the above, WSH courses listed in Table 1 of Annex A will continue to remain suspended. The\ncourses listed in Table 2 of Annex A are allowed to resume subject to the implementation of SMM.\nMandatory WSH Training for Work Permit Holders\n4. Consequent to the above, the mandatory WSH training for work permit holders will continue to be\nsuspended until further notice. This means that new foreign workers (those holding In-Principal Approval IPA)\nwill be able to have their work permit issued even if they did not attend required the WSH training. However, they\ncan only perform lower-risk activities within the resumed businesses2 and under the following conditions:\n(a) Be assigned to work with a buddy who has undergone the required WSH training; and\n(b) Be identified prominently as a new worker (e.g. coloured armband).\n5. Similarly, MOM will allow existing work pass holders to renew their work pass without the mandatory WSH\ntraining. These requirements will apply until the suspension has been lifted, and the worker has attended the\nrequired training within three months (extended from one month previously) after training suspension is lifted.\nTraining Requirements maintained for New WSH Licensees.\n6. There will be no changes in existing training requirements for new application of WSH licenses (e.g.\nWSHO officer, crane operator, approved scaffold contractor, approved crane contractor). This is to ensure the\napproved competent persons and WSH service providers have the necessary competencies to carry out their\nspecified WSH functions and duties safely.\n7. Lastly, we would like to remind all stakeholders especially those resuming business activities to remain\nvigilant and ensure the safety and health of your employees at work.\n1 To resume WSH training activities, all training providers must fulfil requirements of the Checklist of Safe Management\nMeasures (SMM) to resume WSH Training.\n2 For information on resumption of businesses, please refer to https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/\nMinistry of Manpower Occupational Safety and Health Division\nMOM Services Centre, 1500 Bendemeer Road, Singapore 339946 Web www.mom.gov.sg Contact us www.mom.gov.sg/contact Tel 65 6438 5122 Page 1 of 6\nCircular: Suspension of in-person WSH Training involving foreign workers\nAnnex A\nTable 1: List of in-person WSH courses that remained suspended\nS/No. Course Name\n1 WSQ Apply Workplace Safety and Health in Construction Sites\n2 WSQ Apply Workplace Safety and Health in Metal Work\n3 WSQ Apply Workplace Safety and Health in Process Plant\n4 Shipyard Safety Instruction Course for Workers (General Trade) /\nWSQ Apply Workplace Safety and Health in Shipyard (General Trade)\n5 Logistics and Transport Safety Orientation Course /\nWSQ Apply Workplace Safety and Health in Logistics and Transportation\n6 Shipyard Safety Instruction Course for Workers (Hot Work Trade)\n7 Shipyard Safety Instruction Course for Workers (Painter Trade)\n8 Suspended Scaffolding Riggers\u2019 Course /\nWSQ Perform Rigging of Suspended Scaffold\n9 Work-at-Height Course for Workers /\nWSQ Perform Work-at-Height\n10 Metal Scaffold Erection Course /\nWSQ Perform Metal Scaffold Erection\n11 Compressed Air Works (Man-Lock) Attendant Course /\nWSQ Perform Man-lock Attendant Duties for Compressed Air Work\n12 Compressed Air Works (Medical-Lock Attendant) Course /\nWSQ Perform Medical-Lock Attendant Duties for Compressed Air Work\n13 WSQ Perform Work in Confined Space Operation\n14 Formwork Safety Course for Workers /\nWSQ Perform Formwork Activities\n15 Marine Metal Scaffolding Course for Scaffolders /\nWSQ Erect Metal Scaffold in Marine Industry\n16 Explosive Powered Tools Operator Course/\nWSQ Operate Explosive Powered Tools\n17 WSQ Perform Rigger and Signalman tasks\n18 Safety Orientation Course (Tunnelling) for Workers\n19 Commercial Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus Divers Course\n20 Surface Supplied Diving Equipment Divers Course\nMinistry of Manpower Occupational Safety and Health Division\nMOM Services Centre, 1500 Bendemeer Road, Singapore 339946 Web www.mom.gov.sg Contact us www.mom.gov.sg/contact Tel 65 6438 5122 Page 2 of 6\nCircular: Suspension of in-person WSH Training involving foreign workers\nS/No. Course Name\n21 WSQ Operate Forklift\n22 WSQ Operate Lorry Crane\n23 WSQ Operate Vertical Personnel Platform\n24 WSQ Operate Boom Lift\n25 WSQ Operate Scissor Lift\n26 Workshop to Enhance Safety of Crane Operators (WESCO)\n27 Supervision of Metal Scaffold Erection Course /\nWSQ Supervise Metal Scaffold Erection\n28 Suspended Scaffolding Supervisor\u2019s Course /\nWSQ Supervise Suspended Scaffold\n29 Marine Metal Scaffolding Course for Supervisors /\nWSQ Supervise Metal Scaffold in Marine Industry\n30 Formwork Safety Course for Supervisors /\nWSQ Supervise Workplace Safety and Health for Formwork Construction\n31 Shipyard Supervisors Safety Course /\nWSQ Supervise Marine Work for Workplace Safety and Health\n32 Basic Industrial Safety and Health Course for Supervisors /\nWSQ Supervise Manufacturing Work for Workplace Safety and Health\n33 WSQ Supervise Workplace Safety and Health in Process Plant\n34 WSQ Supervise Work in Confined Space Operation\n35 WSQ Supervise Construction Work for Workplace Safety and Health\n36 WSQ Supervise Safe Lifting Operations\n37 WSQ Supervise Tunnelling Work for Workplace Safety and Health\n38 Commercial Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus Diving Supervisors Course\n39 Surface Supplied Diving Equipment Diving Supervisors Course\n40 Managing Work-At-Heights /\nWSQ Manage Work-At-Height\nMinistry of Manpower Occupational Safety and Health Division\nMOM Services Centre, 1500 Bendemeer Road, Singapore 339946 Web www.mom.gov.sg Contact us www.mom.gov.sg/contact Tel 65 6438 5122 Page 3 of 6\nCircular: Suspension of in-person WSH Training involving foreign workers\nTable 2: List of in-person WSH courses that may resume training\nThere may be foreign workers who may also apply to attend such courses.

        "content": "ALL APPROVED PERSONS, APPROVED CRANE CONTRACTORS AND REGISTERED\nCRANE OPERATORS\nAUTOMATIC OVERLOAD CUT-OFF FOR MOBILE AND TOWER CRANES\nIt has come to the attention of the Department that some automatic overload devices\ninstalled in cranes had been set to cut-off at loads greater than the specified safe working\nload. The Department also discovered that some of these overload devices had been\nintentionally by-passed during operation. The Department would like to warn all parties that\nsuch practices are dangerous and unacceptable.\n2. In one case, a crane operator relied on the automatic overload cut-off to assist in his\noperation. Investigation revealed that the cut-off was set at 105% of the safe working load.\nUsing the cut-off as an indicator for overloading condition, the crane operator proceeded to\nlift under an overloaded condition. This caused the crane to tilt and the load to swing\nforward, hitting and killed a worker. The Department also discovered through another\naccident investigation into the buckling of the jib of a crane that the overload cut-off was set\nat 110% of the safe working load. In yet another case, a crane operator had intentionally by-\npassed the automatic overload device so as to enable him to lift a heavy load in an\noverloaded condition. This led to the failure of the mobile tower crane he was operating.\n3. The Department would like to remind all crane operators and personnel engaged in\nlifting operations that it is an offence to load a lifting machine beyond its safe working load.\nThe lifting machine may be overloaded only when directed by an approved person or an\ninspector for the purpose of testing the machine. The bypassing of the overload device to\nenable the lifting of loads beyond the safe working load of a lifting machine is strictly\nprohibited. The Department will not hesitate to take legal action against crane operators or\nany other persons who wilfully bypass such safety devices.\n4. All automatic overload devices shall give an audible warning signal before\nreaching 100% of the specified safe working load and the overload cut-off shall be\nactivated at or below the specified safe working load. Once cut-off, the crane shall only be\npermitted to manoeuvre the load into a safe position, e.g. shortening or raising the boom so\nas to reduce the load radius.\n5. All approved persons are required to test the overload devices during their\ninspections to ensure that the cranes meet the above requirement.\nYours faithfully,\nSILAS SNG WEE KIAT\nfor CHIEF INSPECTOR OF FACTORIES\nDate of Issue Classification: Circular No: CIF A32.4.1\n26 March 2002 Safety Devices OSD/ ENG CIR / LE 2/02 Page 1 of 1",

        "content": "2 May 2012\nOSHD/SPECS/MHI/PS/01-2012\nTo: All refineries, petrochemical and chemical plants handling, processing and/or\nmanufacturing flammable substances\nCircular on De-oiling/Removal of Flammable Liquids from Pipelines\nPipelines containing flammable liquids may be opened from time to time for various\nreasons such as inspection, maintenances etc. Before opening such pipelines, de-\noiling/removal of flammable liquids needs to be done. Such works, if not properly carried\nout, can be extremely hazardous due to the inherent risk of fire and/or explosion from the\nflammable liquids. Companies should take note of the following points when carrying out\nde-oiling of such pipelines.\nDe-oiling/Removal of Flammable Liquids\n2 Open de-oiling of pipeline containing flammable liquids should be avoided. This is\nbecause sources of ignition cannot be totally eliminated in the open. Instead, companies\nshould consider using a closed system. The closed system would entail a closed loop\ndraining of flammable liquids, including a closed loop flushing and/or purging with inert\nmaterials.\nEffective Measures to Prevent Spillage of Flammable Liquids and Eliminate Ignition\nSources\n3 Companies should reduce the risks of fires and/or explosion by addressing the\nunsafe conditions that may result in such accidents. To do so, companies should:\na. Conduct proper identification of pipelines carrying flammable liquids to verify the\nsource and flow, in preparation for the removal of their contents. Up-to-date as-built\ndrawings must be used to identify low-point drains, vent and flush points, branch\nconnections, gauges and isolation valves associated with the pipelines. A walk-down\nof the pipelines should be carried out to verify or positively identify the associated\nfixtures and piping system. Planning of the de-oiling/removal works should take into\naccount these checks.\nOccupational Safety and Health Division\n18 Havelock Rd\nSingapore 059764\nDID : (65) 6438 5122\nFacsimile : (65) 6317 1261\nWebsite : http://www.mom.gov.sg/oshd/\nEmail : mom_oshd@mom.gov.sg\nPage 1 of 2\nb. Take effective measures to prevent the build up of static charges and the generation\nof potential static sparks. Petroleum fuels have low electrical conductivities. As a\nresult, static charges can build up when petroleum fuels move in contact with other\ndissimilar materials. This can occur when petroleum fuels flow through pipes or\nflexible hoses. When enough charges are built up, a spark may be generated and\nfires and/or explosions could result if the vapour-in-air concentration is within the\nflammable range. Pipelines must be effectively earthed to prevent accumulation of\nstatic charges. Measures to prevent the build up of static charges include (but not\nlimited to) proper bonding and grounding, by controlling flow rates in the pipelines\nto reduce the rate of charge generation and etc.\nc. Ensure that risk assessment and safe work procedures take into account the risk of\nfires and/or explosion whenever flammable liquids are involved in de-oiling/removal\nworks. The risk assessment and written safe work procedures should be specific to\nthe pipeline where the removal, flushing and/or purging of flammable liquids is to be\ndone. A permit-to-work (PTW) system should be implemented to control the\nexecution of the removal at critical steps and to ensure that all safety measures are\ncomplied with throughout the removal. Proper lock-out and tag-out procedures\nshould also be in place to isolate the pipeline from the system before removal works\ncommence.\nEnsure Effective Supervision of Work\n4 Supervision should be provided during de-oiling/removal of flammable liquids from\npipelines, including the first break of the line after the necessary flushing and/or purging\nwith inert materials and draining. Where unforeseeable risks not identified in the risk\nassessment are encountered during execution, workers should immediately stop work and\nalert their supervisors and the risks should be effectively addressed before work resumes.\n5 For clarifications, please contact Jaime Lim at Jaime_Lim@mom.gov.sg.\nGO HENG HUAT\nfor Commissioner for Workplace Safety and Health\nOccupational Safety and Health Division\nMinistry of Manpower\nDate of Issue Classification Circular No.\n2 May 2012 Process Safety OSHD/SPECS/MHI/PS/01-2012\nPage 2 of 2",

With reference to the Engineering Circular LE 3/00 on the Luffing Jib Tower\nCrane, the Department had received several feedback on the requirements\nimposed on the braking or locking mechanism on the luffing hoist and main\nhoist drum.\n2. After consultation with some of the crane manufacturers and contractors, it was\nbrought to our attention that the intent of the circular had not been clearly\npresented in the circular. This has led to various mis-interpretations by\napproved persons and approved crane contractors. We therefore regret any\ninconveniences caused.\n3. The intention of the circular LE 3/00 is to ensure that there is an efficient\nbraking or locking mechanism installed onto both the luffing hoist drum and the\nmain hoist drum of the tower crane, to prevent the free unwinding of the\ndrum when the power is cut off or when the drive mechanism fails.\n4. All Approved Persons must be satisfied that the braking mechanism acting\ndirectly or indirectly on the drum can effectively prevent any free unwinding of\nthe drum before certifying the tower crane for safe use.\n5. All Approved Crane Contractors for tower cranes are also reminded to carry out\nregular checks and maintenance on the brake mechanism. The transmission\nmechanism shall also be maintained regularly to ensure that it is properly\nlubricated so as to prevent excessive wear.\n6.

        "content": "15 May 2017\nAuthorised Examiners (Lifting Equipment)\nREVISED STATUTORY EXAMINATION REQUIREMENTS FOR LORRY CRANES\nBackground\nThe Land Transport Authority (LTA) has required lorry cranes1 and truck-mounted mobile\nelevating work platforms (TM-MEWPs) to be fitted with an audio warning system to reduce the\nrisk of these vehicles colliding with overhead structures. Lorry cranes and TM-MEWPs newly\nregistered with the LTA on or after 1 January 2017 are required to have been installed with an\naudio warning system. Existing lorry crane and TM-MEWP registered before 1 January 2017 are\nrequired to be installed with the audio warning system by 30 September 2017.\n2 The audio warning system shall include an audio buzzer in the driver\u2019s cabin linked either\nto a limit switch installed at the base or to an angle sensor fitted on the inner boom of the crane.\nThe audio warning system shall emit an alarm when the limit switch detects that the boom is not\nfully stowed or when the angle sensor detects that the boom is above its maximum permissible\nstow height when the lorry is being driven.\nStatutory Examination of Lorry Cranes from 1 October 2017\n3 Effective from 1 October 2017, Authorised Examiners (AEs) conducting statutory\nexamination of lorry cranes and TM-MEWPs are also required to carry out test and examination\nof the audio warning system. Among others, AEs shall check that the audio warning system is in\ngood working condition, which include ensuring that the alarm would be activated when the\nboom is not fully stowed or when the angle sensor detected the boom is above its maximum\npermissible stow height. AEs shall also check that the said system is not altered or tampered\nwith such that it defeated its intended purpose.\n4 When the AE is satisfied that the audio warning system is in good working condition and\ncomplies with the requirements stated in paragraph 3, the AE shall include the following remark\n1 Lorry fitted with an articulated arm used for loading, unloading and lifting of materials or goods\nDate of Issue Classification Circular No.\n15 May 2017 Lifting Equipment OSHD/SPECS/ESB/LE/02-2017\nin the Comments/Observations field of Form B \u2013 Certificate of Test/Thorough Visual Examination\nof Lifting Equipment (LE Certificate): \u201cHeight audio warning system is fitted, in good working\ncondition and not altered/deactivated\u201d.

All lorries mounted with\ncranes before 1 January 2017 have up to 30 September 2017 to comply with this\nrequirement.\nThe audio warning system features an audio buzzer in the driver\u2019s cabin which\nis linked either to a limit switch installed at the base of the crane or to an angle sensor\nfitted on the inner crane boom. The system will emit a sound to alert the driver when\nthe crane boom is not adequately stowed.\nInspection of Lorry Cranes\u2019 Audio Warning Systems\nCurrently, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) requires all lifting equipment,\nincluding lorries mounted with cranes, to be examined by their Authorised Examiners\n(AEs) during annual crane inspections. LTA has worked with MOM to include checks\non the lorry crane\u2019s audio warning system during the annual crane inspections. This\nwill commence from 1 October 2017. During the annual crane inspections, the AEs\n1\nwill check and certify the function of the audio warning system. Lorry cranes must\nhave an audio warning system that is maintain in good working condition. Otherwise,\nit would not be issued with a valid crane inspection certificate.\nFrom 1 October 2017, LTA\u2019s Authorised Inspection Centres would also check\nfor the validity of the crane inspection certificates during periodic vehicle inspections.\nLorry cranes with an invalid certificate, or a defective or tampered audio warning\nsystem would not be able to pass the inspection and their owners would not be able to\nrenew the vehicle\u2019s road tax.\nIf the annual crane inspection of your lorry crane is due before the periodic\nvehicle inspection, you are strongly encouraged to approach an AE for the check and\ncertification on the audio warning system before sending the lorry crane for the\nperiodic vehicle inspection. Alternatively, you may engage a registered Professional\nEngineer (Electrical or Mechanical Engineering), to check and certify that the audio\nwarning system is maintained in good working condition.\nIf you have any enquiry or require any assistance on the above-mentioned\nmatter, you may also write to LTA at www.lta.gov.sg/feedback.\nThank you.\nYours sincerely\nTan Zhi Chiang\nDeputy Director, Vehicle Approval & Control\nVehicle Services Group\n2\nNews Release\nNo.1 Hampshire Road Singapore 219428\nTel: 1800-CALL LTA (1800-2255 582) Fax: (65) 6396 1595\nDate of Issue: 30 November 2016\nMeasures to Improve Safety of Over-Height Vehicles\nNew Audio Warning System for Lorries with Cranes\nFrom 2017, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) will require all lorries with cranes to\nbe fitted with an audio warning system to reduce the risk of collision with overhead road\nstructures.\n2 Since 2013, there have been 20 cases of overhead road structures being hit by over-\nheight vehicles. Many of these incidents could have been prevented if the drivers had stowed\nthe cranes before setting off.\nNew Audio Warning System for Lorries with Cranes\n3 From 1 January 2017, all lorries with cranes mounted after 1 January 2017 will be\nrequired to install an audio warning system. All existing lorries with cranes have until 30\nSeptember 2017 to comply with this requirement.\n4 The audio warning system features an audio buzzer in the driver\u2019s cabin which is linked\nto a limit switch installed at the base of the crane. If a limit switch is installed, the buzzer\nwould be activated when the limit switch detects that the crane is not fully stowed.\n5 In cases whereby cranes are unable to be fully stowed due to operational reasons, an\nangle sensor can be installed on the crane\u2019s inner boom instead of the limit switch. When the\nsensor detects that the crane is not fully stowed and is above its maximum stowed height, the\naudio buzzer would be activated to alert the driver to retract the crane adequately before\nmoving off. Illustrations of the audio warning systems are shown in Annex A.\nRoad Humps at Selected Locations with High Covered Linkways\n6 To further enhance road safety, road humps will be implemented at six locations with\nhigh covered linkways by February 2017. The road humps will help reduce the speed of the\nover-height vehicles approaching the high covered linkways and lessen the impact if any\nover-height vehicle were to hit the high covered linkway.\nPenalties for Damaging Road Structures\n7 Drivers of over-height vehicles are reminded to be cautious while driving and look out\nfor overhead road structures. Drivers who are found guilty of damaging road\nstructures/buildings can be fined a maximum of $5,000 and/or be jailed up to two years.\nRepeat offenders can be fined a maximum of $10,000 and/or be jailed up to 5 years.\n3\n8 If a collision is caused by a driver driving a vehicle more than 4.5 m in height without\npolice escort, a first time offender will be liable on conviction to a maximum fine of $2,000\nand be jailed up to three years and may also be disqualified from driving.\n9 LTA will continue to engage vehicle owners and drivers through letters, brochures and\nstickers, on driving safely and reducing the risk of collision with overhead road structures.\n10 More information can also be found on LTA\u2019s One.Motoring website at:\nhttps://www.onemotoring.com.sg/content/onemotoring/en/on_the_roads/road_facilities/heavy\nvehicle.html\nAnnex A: Illustrations of the Audio Warning Systems\n4\nAnnex A\nIllustrations of the Audio Warning Systems\n\u2022 Limit Switch Audio Warning System\nA limit switch audio warning system consists of a mechanical lever switch linked to an audio buzzer in the driver\u2019s cabin. The limit switch is\ninstalled at the base of the crane (or home position) and the crane boom rests on a lever of the limit switch (circled in yellow) when the crane\nboom is fully stowed. The audio buzzer in driver\u2019s cabin will not be activated when crane boom is fully stowed.\nWhen the crane boom is not fully stowed, the mechanical lever will be lifted, and the buzzer in the driver\u2019s cabin would be activated to warn\nthe driver that the crane is not fully stowed.\nHome Position\nFully Stowed Position Position of audio Crane is not fully Position of audio\n(Buzzer is not activated) warning system lever stowed (Buzzer is warning system lever\nwhen buzzer is not activated) when buzzer is\nactivated activated\n5\n\u2022 Angle Sensor Audio Warning System\nAn angle sensor audio warning system consists of an angle sensor linked to a warning buzzer in the driver\u2019s cabin. The angle sensor could be\ninstalled on the inner crane boom and measures the angle of the inner crane boom. When the crane is raised above its maximum stowed height\n(height measured from the ground to the highest point of the fully stowed crane), the buzzer in the driver\u2019s cabin would be activated to remind\nthe drivers to retract their cranes adequately before moving off.\nPositions of Adequately Stowed Crane Boom (Audio Warning System not Activated)\nCrane boom fully stowed (home position) Crane boom rested on deck Crane boom at horizontal position\nPositions of Inadequately Stowed Crane Boom (Audio Warning System Activated)\nCrane booms above maximum stowed height\n6",
